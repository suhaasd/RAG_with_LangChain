A particularly intriguing\\napplication of LLMs is code generation, a task that involves producing source code from natural\\nlanguage descriptions. Despite varying definitions across studies [51, 221, 238, 269], for the main\\nscope of this survey, we focus on the code generation task and adopt a consistent definition of code\\ngeneration as the natural-language-to-code (NL2Code) task [16, 17, 307]. To enhance clarity, the\\ndifferentiation between code generation and other code-related tasks, along with a more nuanced\\ndefinition, is summarized in Table 1. This area has garnered substantial interest from both academia\\nand industry, as evidenced by the development of tools like GitHub Copilot2 [48], CodeGeeX3 [321],\\nand Amazon CodeWhisperer4, which leverage groundbreaking code LLMs to facilitate software\\ndevelopment.\\nInitial investigations into code generation primarily utilized heuristic rules or expert systems,\\nsuch as probabilistic grammar-based frameworks [10, 62, 119, 125, 288] and specialized language\\nmodels [64, 83, 117]. These early techniques were typically rigid and difficult to scale. However,\\nthe introduction of Transformer-based LLMs has shifted the paradigm, establishing them as the\\npreferred method due to their superior proficiency and versatility. One remarkable aspect of LLMs is\\ntheir capability to follow instructions [56, 187, 200, 275, 289], enabling even novice programmers to\\nwrite code by simply articulating their requirements. This emergent ability has democratized coding,\\nmaking it accessible to a broader audience [307]. The performance of LLMs on code generation\\ntasks has seen remarkable improvements, as illustrated by the HumanEval leaderboard5, which\\nshowcases the evolution from PaLM 8B [54] of 3.6% to LDB [325] of 95.1% on Pass@1 metrics.\\nAs can be seen, the HumanEval benchmark [48] has been established as a de facto standard for\\nevaluating the coding proficiency of LLMs [48].\\nTo offer a comprehensive chronological evolution, we present an overview of the development\\nof LLMs for code generation, as illustrated in Figure 1. The landscape of LLMs for code generation\\nis characterized by a spectrum of models, with certain models like ChatGPT [200], GPT4 [5],\\nLLaMA [252, 253], and Claude 3 [14] serving general-purpose applications, while others such\\nas StarCoder [147, 170], Code LLaMA [227], DeepSeek-Coder [88], and Code Gemma [59] are\\ntailored specifically for code-centric tasks. The convergence of code generation with the latest LLM\\nadvancements is pivotal, especially when programming languages can be considered as distinct\\ndialects of multilingual natural language [16, 321]. These models are not only tested against software\\nengineering (SE) requirements but also propel the advancement of LLMs into practical production\\n[317].\\nWhile recent surveys have shed light on code LLMs from the lenses of Natural Language Pro-\\ncessing (NLP), Software Engineering (SE), or a combination of both disciplines [74, 101, 174, 307,\\n317, 324], they have often encompassed a broad range of code-related tasks. There remains a dearth\\nof literature specifically reviewing advanced topics in code generation, such as meticulous data\\ncuration, instruction tuning, alignment with feedback, prompting techniques, the development of\\nautonomous coding agents, retrieval augmented code generation, LLM-as-a-Judge for code genera-\\ntion, among others. A notably pertinent study [16, 307] also concentrates on LLMs for text-to-code\\ngeneration (NL2Code), yet it primarily examines models released from 2020 to 2022.

In Section 6, we underscore the critical\\nchallenges and promising opportunities for bridging the research-practicality gap and conclude\\nthis work in Section 7.\\n2\\nBACKGROUND\\n2.1\\nLarge Language Models\\nThe effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally attributed to their substantial\\nquantity of model parameters, large-scale and diversified datasets, and the immense computational\\npower utilized during training [97, 127]. Generally, scaling up language models consistently results\\nin enhanced performance and sample efficiency across a broad array of downstream tasks [275, 319].\\nHowever, with the expansion of the model size to a certain extent (e.g., GPT-3 [33] with 175B-\\nparameters and PaLM [54] with 540B), LLMs have exhibited an unpredictable phenomenon known\\nas emergent abilities6, including instruction following [200], in-context learning [70], and step-\\nby-step reasoning [105, 276], which are absent in smaller models but apparent in larger ones\\n[275].\\nAdhering to the same architectures of the Transformer [257] in LLMs, code LLMs are specifically\\npre-trained (or continually pre-trained on general LLMs) using large-scale unlabeled code corpora\\nwith a smaller portion of text (and math) data, whereas general-purpose LLMs are pre-trained\\nprimarily on large-scale text data, incorporating a smaller amount of code and math data to\\nenhance logical reasoning capabilities. Additionally, some code LLMs, such as Qwen2.5-Coder\\n[109], incorporate synthetic data in their training processes, a practice that is attracting increasing\\nattention from both industry and academia. Analogous to LLMs, Code LLMs can also be classified\\ninto three architectural categories: encoder-only models, decoder-only models, and encoder-decoder\\nmodels. For encoder-only models, such as CodeBERT [76], they are typically suitable for code\\ncomprehension tasks including type prediction, code retrieval, and clone detection. For decoder-\\nonly models, such as StarCoder [33], they predominantly excel in generation tasks, such as code\\ngeneration, code translation, and code summarization. Encoder-decoder models, such as CodeT5\\n[271], can accommodate both code understanding and generation tasks but do not necessarily\\noutperform encoder-only or decoder-only models. The overall architectures of the different Code\\nLLMs for code generation are depicted in Figure 2.\\nIn the following subsection, we will delineate the key modules of the Transformer layers in Code\\nLLMs.\\n2.1.1\\nMulti-Head Self-Attention Modules. Each Transformer layer incorporates a multi-head self-\\nattention (MHSA) mechanism to discern the inherent semantic relationships within a sequence\\nof tokens across ℎdistinct latent representation spaces. Formally, the MHSA employed by the\\nTransformer can be formulated as follows:\\nh(𝑙) = MultiHeadSelfAttn(Q, K, V) = Concat {Head𝑖}ℎ\\n𝑖=1 WO,\\n(1)\\nHead𝑖= Attention(H(𝑙−1)WQ\\n𝑖\\n|      {z      }\\nQ\\n, H(𝑙−1)WK\\n𝑖\\n|      {z      }\\nK\\n, H(𝑙−1)WV\\n𝑖\\n|      {z      }\\nV\\n),\\n(2)\\n6It should be noted that an LLM is not necessarily superior to a smaller language model, and emergent abilities may not\\nmanifest in all LLMs [319].\\nJ.

Within the decoder layers of the Transformer, the\\nself-attention mechanism is constrained by introducing an attention mask, ensuring that\\nqueries at each position can only attend to all key-value pairs up to and inclusive of that\\nposition. To facilitate parallel training, this is typically executed by assigning a value of 0\\nto the lower triangular part and setting the remaining elements to −∞. Consequently, each\\nitem attends only to its predecessors and itself.

Within each Transformer layer, a Position-wise Feed-\\nForward Network (PFFN) is leveraged following the MHSA sub-layer to refine the sequence\\nembeddings at each position 𝑖in a separate and identical manner, thereby encoding more intricate\\nfeature representations.

To alleviate the issue of vanishing or exploding\\ngradients resulting from network deepening, the Transformer model incorporates a residual con-\\nnection [94] around each of the aforementioned modules, followed by Layer Normalization [18].\\nFor the placement of Layer Normalization operation, there are two widely used approaches: 1)\\nPost-Norm: Layer normalization is implemented subsequent to the element-wise residual addition,\\nin accordance with the vanilla Transformer [257]. 2) Pre-Norm: Layer normalization is applied to\\nthe input of each sub-layer, as seen in models like GPT-2 [214]. Formally, it can be formulated as:\\nPost-Norm : H(l) = LayerNorm(PFFN(h(l)) + h(l)),\\nh(l) = LayerNorm(MHSA(H(l−1)) + H(l−1))\\n(8)\\nPre-Norm : H(l) = PFFN(LayerNorm(h(l))) + h(l),\\nh(l) = MHSA(LayerNorm(H(l−1))) + H(l−1)\\n(9)\\n2.1.4\\nPositional Encoding.

Subsequently, each position embedding is added to the corresponding token embedding,\\nand the sum is fed into the Transformer. Since the inception of this method, a variety of innovative\\npositional encoding approaches have emerged, such as learnable embeddings [66], relative position\\nembeddings [232], RoPE [243], and ALiBi [211]. For more detailed descriptions of each method,\\nplease consult [157, 318].\\n2.1.5\\nArchitecture. There are two types of Transformer architecture for code generation task,\\nincluding encoder-decoder and decoder-only. For the encoder-decoder architecture, it consists of\\nboth an encoder and a decoder, in which the encoder processes the input data and generates a\\nset of representations, which are then used by the decoder to produce the output. However, for\\ndecoder-only architecture, it consists only of the decoder part of the transformer, where it uses\\na single stack of layers to both process input data and generate output. Therefore, the encoder-\\ndecoder architecture is suited for tasks requiring mapping between different input and output\\ndomains, while the decoder-only architecture is designed for tasks focused on sequence generation\\nand continuation. The overview of LLMs with these two architectures are illustrated in Figure 2.\\n2.2\\nCode Generation\\nLarge language models (LLMs) for code generation refer to the use of LLM to generate source\\ncode from natural language descriptions, a process also known as a natural-language-to-code\\ntask. Typically, these natural language descriptions encompass programming problem statements\\n(or docstrings) and may optionally include some programming context (e.g., function signatures,\\nassertions, etc.). Formally, these natural language (NL) descriptions can be represented as x. Given x,\\nthe use of an LLM with model parameters 𝜃to generate a code solution y can be denoted as 𝑃𝜃(y | x).\\nThe advent of in-context learning abilities in LLM [275] has led to the appending of exemplars to\\nthe natural language description x as demonstrations to enhance code generation performance or\\nconstrain the generation format [145, 206]. A fixed set of 𝑀exemplars is denoted as {(xi, yi)}𝑀\\n𝑖=1.\\nConsequently, following [190], a more general formulation of LLMs for code generation with\\nfew-shot (or zero-shot) exemplars can be revised as:\\n𝑃𝜃(y | x) ⇒𝑃𝜃(y | prompt(x, {(xi, yi)}𝑘\\n𝑖=1)),𝑘∈{0, 1, . . . , 𝑀}\\n(12)\\nwhere prompt(x, {(xi, yi)}𝑘\\n𝑖=1)) is a string representation of the overall input, and {(xi, yi)}𝑘\\n𝑖=1\\ndenotes a set of 𝑘exemplars randomly selected from {(xi, yi)}𝑀\\n𝑖=1. In particular, when 𝑘= 0, this\\ndenotes zero-shot code generation, equivalent to vanilla ones without in-context learning. In the\\ndecoding process, a variety of decoding strategies can be performed for code generation, including\\ndeterministic-based strategies (e.g., greedy search and beam search) and sampling-based strategies\\n(e.g., temperature sampling, top-k sampling, and top-p (nucleus) sampling). For more detailed\\ndescriptions of each decoding strategy, please consult [99]. For example, the greedy search and\\nsampling-based decoding strategies can be formulated as follows:\\nGreedy Search : y∗= argmax\\ny\\n𝑃𝜃(y | prompt(x, {(xi, yi)}𝑘\\n𝑖=1)),𝑘∈{0, 1, . . . , 𝑀}\\n(13)\\nSampling : y ∼𝑃𝜃(y | prompt(x, {(xi, y𝑖)}𝑘\\n𝑖=1)),𝑘∈{0, 1, . . . , 𝑀}\\n(14)\\nTo verify the functionality correctness of the generated code solution, y is subsequently executed\\nvia a compiler or interpreter, represented as Exe(·), on a suit of unit tests T. The feedback from\\nthis execution can be denoted as Feedback(Exe(y, T)). If the generated code solution fails to pass\\nall test cases, the error feedback can be iteratively utilized to refine the code by leveraging the\\nJ. ACM, Vol. 37, No. 4, Article 1.

In cases of\\ndisagreement, the third author makes the final inclusion decision.\\n3.4\\nQuality Assessment\\nTo ensure the inclusion of high-quality studies, we have developed a comprehensive set of ten\\nQuality Assessment Criteria (QAC) following [101]. These QAC are designed to evaluate the\\nrelevance, clarity, validity, and significance of the papers considered for our review.\\nIn accordance with [101], the first three QAC assess the study’s alignment with our objectives.\\nThese criteria are rated as “irrelevant/unmet”, “partially relevant/met”, or “relevant/fully met”,\\ncorresponding to scores of -1, 0, and 1, respectively. If a study receive a score of -1 across these\\ninitial three criteria, it is deemed ineligible for further consideration and subsequently excluded\\nfrom our review process.\\nThe subsequent seven QAC focus on a more detailed content evaluation, employing a scoring\\nrange of -1 to 2, representing “poor”, “fair”, “good”, and “excellent”. We compute a cumulative score\\nbased on the responses to QAC4 through QAC10 for each paper. For published works, the maximum\\nachievable score is 14 (2 points per question). We retain those with a score of 11.2 (80% of the total\\nscore) or higher. For unpublished papers available on arXiv, QAC4 defaults to a score of 0, making\\nthe maximum possible score for the remaining criteria 12. Accordingly, we retain papers scoring\\n9.6 (80% of the adjusted total score) or above .\\n• QAC1: Is the research not classified as a secondary study, such as a systematic literature\\nreview or survey? (-1, 0, 1)\\n• QAC2: Does the study incorporate the use of LLMs? (-1, 0, 1)\\n• QAC3: Is the study relevant to the code generation task? (-1, 0, 1)\\n• QAC4: Is the research published in a prestigious venue? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC5: Does the study present a clear research motivation? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC6: Are the key contributions and limitations of the study discussed? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC7: Does the study contribute to the academic or industrial community? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC8: Are the LLM techniques employed in the study clearly described? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC9: Are the experimental setups, including experimental environments and dataset infor-\\nmation, thoroughly detailed? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n• QAC10: Does the study clearly confirm its experimental findings? (-1, 0, 1, 2)\\n3.5\\nSnowballing Search\\nFollowing the quality assessment, we establish an initial set of papers for our study. To minimize\\nthe risk of excluding pertinent literature, we implement a snowballing search strategy. Snowballing\\nsearch involves utilizing a paper’s reference list or its citations to discover additional relevant\\nstudies, known as backward and forward snowballing, respectively. In this survey, we exclusively\\nemployed backward snowballing following [260]. Despite this effort, no additional studies are\\nidentified through this method. This could be attributed to the task-specific nature of the code\\ngeneration (natural-language-to-code), where reference studies are typically published earlier.\\nConsequently, our methodology, which encompassed an extensive manual and automated search,\\nlikely covered the relevant literature comprehensively, explaining the lack of additional studies\\nthrough snowballing search.\\n3.6\\nData Collection and Analysis\\nThe data collection process for our study, illustrated in Figure 3, began with a manual search\\nthrough conference proceedings and journal articles from leading venues in LLMs and SE.

Despite the absence of peer review on arXiv, our quality assessment process\\nensures that only high-quality papers are included, thereby maintaining the integrity of this survey.\\nFurthermore, the annual trend in the number of collected papers indicates nearly exponential\\ngrowth in the field. From a single paper in the period 2018 to 2020, the numbers increased to 6 in\\n2021, 11 in 2022, 75 in 2023, and 140 in 2024. This trend reflects growing interest and attention\\nin this research area, with expectations for continued expansion in the future. Additionally, to\\ncapture the breadth of advancements in LLMs for code generation, we conducted a distribution\\nanalysis of the research topics covered in the included papers, as shown at the bottom of Figure 4.\\nWe observe that the development of LLMs for code generation closely aligns with broader trends\\nin general-purpose LLM research. Notably, the most prevalent research topics are Pre-training and\\nFoundation Models (21.5%), Prompting (11.8%), and Evaluation and Benchmarks (24.1%). These\\nareas hold significant promise for enhancing, refining, and evaluating LLM-driven code generation.\\n4\\nTAXONOMY\\nThe recent surge in the development of LLMs has led to a significant number of these models\\nbeing repurposed for code generation task through continual pre-training or fine-tuning. This\\ntrend is particularly observable in the realm of open-source models. For instance, Meta AI initially\\nmade the LLaMA [252] model publicly available, which was followed by the release of Code Llama\\n[227], designed specifically for code generation. Similarly, DeepSeek LLM [26] developed and\\nreleased by DeepSeek has been extended to create DeepSeek Coder [88], a variant tailored for code\\ngeneration. The Qwen team has developed and released Code Qwen [249], building on their original\\nQwen [20] model. Microsoft, on the other hand, has unveiled WizardLM [289] and is exploring its\\ncoding-oriented counterpart, WizardCoder [173]. Google has joined the fray by releasing Gemma\\n[248], subsequently followed by Code Gemma [59]. Beyond simply adapting general-purpose LLMs\\nfor code-related tasks, there has been a proliferation of models specifically engineered for code\\ngeneration. Notable examples include StarCoder [147], OctoCoder [187], and CodeGen [193]. These\\nmodels underscore the trend of LLMs being developed with a focus on code generation.\\nRecognizing the importance of these developments, we conduct a thorough analysis of selected\\npapers on LLMs for code generation, sourced from widely used scientific databases as mentioned\\nin Section 3. Based on this analysis, we propose a taxonomy that categorizes and evaluates the\\nlatest advancements in LLMs for code generation. This taxonomy, depicted in Figure 6, serves as a\\ncomprehensive reference for researchers seeking to quickly familiarize themselves with the state-\\nof-the-art in this dynamic field. It is important to highlight that the category of recent advances\\nemphasizes the core techniques used in the current state-of-the-art code LLMs.\\nIn the subsequent sections, we will provide an in-depth analysis of each category related to code\\ngeneration. This will encompass a definition of the problem, the challenges to be addressed, and a\\ncomparison of the most prominent models and their performance evaluation.\\n5\\nLARGE LANGAUGE MODELS FOR CODE GENERATION\\nLLMs with Transformer architecture have revolutionized a multitude of fields, and their application\\nin code generation has been particularly impactful. These models follow a comprehensive process\\nthat starts with the curation and synthesis of code data, followed by a structured training approach\\nthat includes pre-training and fine-tuning (instruction tuning), reinforcement learning with various\\nfeedback, and the use of sophisticated prompt engineering techniques. Recent advancements have\\nseen the integration of repository-level and retrieval-augmented code generation, as well as the\\ndevelopment of autonomous coding agents.

Fortunately, multiple platforms and websites\\noffer large-scale, open-source, and permissively licensed code corpora, such as GitHub7 and Stack\\nOverflow8. Notably, the number of stars or forks of GitHub repositories has emerged as a valuable\\nmetric for filtering high-quality code datasets. In a similar vein, the quantity of votes on Stack\\nOverflow can serve to discern the most relevant and superior answers.\\nNonetheless, raw datasets are frequently laden with redundant, noisy data and personal infor-\\nmation, eliciting concerns regarding privacy leakage, which may include the names and email\\naddresses of repository contributors [8, 37, 137]. Consequently, it is essential to undertake rigorous\\ndata-cleaning procedures. Typically, this process encompasses exact match deduplication, code\\ndata filtering based on average line length and a defined threshold for the fraction of alphanumeric\\ncharacters, the removal of auto-generated files through keyword searches, and the expunction of\\npersonal user data [132, 254]. Specifically, the standard data preprocessing workflow is depicted in\\nFigure 7.\\nThe development of a proficient LLM for code generation necessitates the utilization of various\\ntypes of code data at different developmental stages. Therefore, we categorize code data into three\\ndistinct classes: pre-training datasets, instruction-tuning datasets, and benchmarks for performance\\nevaluation. The subsequent subsections will provide a detailed illustration of code data within each\\nclassification.\\n5.1.1\\nPre-training. The remarkable success of bidirectional pre-trained language models (PLMs)\\nsuch as BERT [66] and unidirectional PLMs like GPT [213] has firmly established the practice of\\npre-training on large-scale unlabeled datasets to endow models with a broad spectrum of general\\nknowledge. Extending this principle to the realm of code generation enables LLMs to assimilate\\nfundamental coding principles, including the understanding of code structure dependencies, the\\nsemantics of code identifiers, and the intrinsic logic of code sequences [48, 85, 269, 271]. In light of\\nthis advancement, there has been a proliferation of large-scale unlabeled code datasets proposed\\nto serve as the foundational training ground for LLMs to develop coding proficiency. A brief\\nintroduction of these datasets is as follows, with the statistics available in Table 4.\\n• CodeSearchNet [110]: CodeSearchNet corpus is a comprehensive dataset, consisting of 2\\nmillion (comment, code) pairs from open-source repositories on GitHub. It includes code\\nand documentation in several programming languages including Go, Java, PHP, Python,\\nJavaScript, and Ruby. The dataset was primarily compiled to promote research into the\\nproblem of code retrieval using natural language.\\n• Google BigQuery [96]: the Google BigQuery Public Datasets program offers a full snapshot\\nof the content of more than 2.8 million open source GitHub repositories in BigQuery.\\n• The Pile [78]: the Pile is an 825 GiB diverse and open source language modeling dataset\\naggregating 22 smaller, high-quality datasets including GitHub, Books3, and Wikipedia (en).\\nIt aims to encompass text from as many modalities as possible, thereby facilitating the\\ndevelopment of models with broader generalization capabilities. For code generation, the\\nGitHub composite is specifically utilized.\\n• CodeParrot [254]: the CodeParrot dataset contains Python files used to train the code genera-\\ntion model in Chapter 10: Training Transformers from Scratch in the “NLP with Transformers\\n7https://github.com\\n8https://stackoverflow.com\\nJ.

It is important to highlight that logical reasoning encompasses math-\\nrelated benchmarks, as it aims to create “code-based solutions” for solving complex mathematical\\nproblems [50, 79, 326]. This strategy can therefore mitigate the limitations of LLMs in performing\\nintricate mathematical computations. The statistics for these benchmarks are presented in Table 6.\\nGeneral\\n• HumanEval [48]: HumanEval comprises 164 manually scripted Python programming prob-\\nlems, each featuring a function signature, docstring, body, and multiple unit tests.\\n• HumanEval+ [162]: HumanEval+ extends the original HumanEval [48] benchmark by in-\\ncreasing the scale of the test cases by 80 times. As the test cases increase, HumanEval+ can\\ncatch significant amounts of previously undetected incorrect code synthesized by LLMs.\\n• HumanEvalPack [187]: expands HumanEval [48] by extending it to encompass three coding\\ntasks across six programming languages, namely code synthesis, code repair, and code\\nexplanation.\\n• MBPP [17]: MBPP is a collection of approximately 974 Python programming problems, crowd-\\nsourced and designed for entry-level programmers. Each problem comes with an English\\ntask description, a code solution, and three automated test cases.\\n• MBPP+ [162]: MBPP+ enhances MBPP [17] by eliminating ill-formed problems and rectifying\\nproblems with incorrect implementations. The test scale of MBPP+ is also expanded by 35\\ntimes for test augmentation.\\n• CoNaLa [297]: CoNaLa contains almost 597K data samples for evaluating Python code\\ngeneration. The curated part of CoNaLa is crawled from Stack Overflow, automatically\\nfiltered, and then curated by annotators. The mined part of CoNaLais automatically mined,\\nwith almost 600k examples.\\n• Spider [300]: Spider is large-scale complex text-to-SQL dataset covering 138 different domains.\\nIt has over 10K questions and 5.6K complex SQL queries on 200 databases. This dataset aims\\nto test a model’s ability to generalize to SQL queries, database schemas, and new domains.\\n• CONCODE [113]: CONCODE is a dataset with over 100K samples consisting of Java classes\\nfrom public GitHub repositories. It provides near zero-shot conditions that can test the\\nmodel’s ability to generalize to unseen natural language tokens with unseen environments.\\n• ODEX [273]: ODEX is an open-domain dataset focused on the execution-based generation\\nof Python code from natural language. It features 945 pairs of natural language queries and\\ntheir corresponding Python code, all extracted from StackOverflow forums.\\n• CoderEval [299]: CoderEval is a pragmatic code generation benchmark that includes 230\\nPython and 230 Java code generation problems.

The comparison among three representative data synthesis methods used for generating instruction\\ndata with LLMs. The Code Alpaca [43] employs the self-instruct method, whereas WizardCoder [173] and\\nMagicoder [278] utilize the Evol-Instruct and OSS-Instruct methods, respectively.\\nLIMA model, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with a standard supervised loss\\non a mere 1,000 meticulously curated prompts and responses, achieved performance on par with, or\\neven superior to, GPT-4 in 43% of evaluated cases. This figure rose to 58% when compared to Bard\\nand 65% against DaVinci003, all without the use of reinforcement learning or human preference\\nmodeling [328]. The QuRating initiative strategically selects pre-training data embodying four key\\ntextual qualities — writing style, facts & trivia, required expertise, and educational value — that\\nresonate with human intuition. Training a 1.3B parameter model on such data resulted in reduced\\nperplexity and stronger in-context learning compared to baseline models [280].\\nDespite these advancements, acquiring quality data remains a significant challenge due to issues\\nsuch as data scarcity, privacy concerns, and prohibitive costs [165, 268]. Human-generated data is\\noften labor-intensive and expensive to produce, and it may lack the necessary scope and detail to\\nnavigate complex, rare, or ambiguous scenarios. As a resolution to these challenges, synthetic data\\nhas emerged as a viable alternative. By generating artificial datasets that replicate the intricacies\\nof real-world information, models such as GPT-3.5-turbo [196] and GPT-4 [5] have enabled the\\ncreation of rich datasets without the need for human annotation [92, 138, 165, 268]. This approach\\nis particularly beneficial in enhancing the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, with a focus\\non generating synthetic instruction-based data.\\nA notable example of this approach is the Self-Instruct [268] framework, which employs an off-the-\\nshelf language model to generate a suite of instructions, inputs, and outputs. This data is then refined\\nby removing invalid or redundant entries before being used to fine-tune the model. The empirical\\nevidence supports the efficacy of this synthetic data generation methodology. Building upon this\\nconcept, the Alpaca [247] model, fine-tuned on 52k pieces of instruction-following data from a 7B\\nparameter LLaMa [252] model, exhibits performance comparable to the text-davinci-003 model.\\nWizardLM [289] introduced the Evol-Instruct technique, which incrementally transforms simple\\ninstructions into more complex variants. The fine-tuned LLaMa model using this technique has\\nshown promising results in comparison to established proprietary LLMs such as ChatGPT [196] and\\nGPT-4 [5], to some extent. Moreover, Microsoft has contributed to this field with their Phi series of\\nmodels, predominantly trained on synthetic high-quality data, which includes Phi-1 (1.3B) [84]\\nfor Python coding, Phi-1.5 (1.3B) [150] for common sense reasoning and language understanding,\\nPhi-2 (2.7B) [182] for advanced reasoning and language understanding, and Phi-3 (3.8B) [4] for\\nJ.

These models have consistently outperformed larger counterparts across various\\nbenchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of synthetic data in model training.\\nDrawing on the successes of data synthesis for general-purpose LLMs, researchers have expanded\\nthe application of synthetic data to the realm of code generation. The Code Alpaca model, as de-\\nscribed in [43], has been fine-tuned on a 7B and 13B LLaMA model using a dataset of 20k instruction-\\nfollowing examples for code generation. This dataset was created by text-davinci-00310 and\\nemployed the Self-Instruct technique [268]. Building on this, the WizardCoder 15B [173] utilizes\\nthe Evol-Instruct technique to create an enhanced dataset of 78k evolved code instruction examples.\\nThis dataset originates from the initial 20k instruction-following dataset used by Code Alpaca\\n[43], which was also generated by text-davinci-003. The WizardCoder model, fine-tuned on\\nthe StarCoder [147] base model, achieved a 57.3% pass@1 on the HumanEval benchmarks. This\\nperformance not only surpasses all other open-source Code LLMs by a significant margin but also\\noutperforms leading closed LLMs such as Anthropic’s Claude and Google’s Bard. In a similar vein,\\nMagicoder [278] introduces a novel data synthesis approach termed OSS-INSTRUCT which enlight-\\nens LLMs with open-source code snippets to generate high-quality instruction data for coding tasks.\\nIt aims to address the inherent biases often present in synthetic data produced by LLMs. Building\\nupon CodeLlama [227], the MagicoderS-CL-7B model — fine-tuned with 75k synthetic instruction\\ndata using the OSS-INSTRUCT technique and with gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 as the data generator —\\nhas outperformed the prominent ChatGPT on the HumanEval Plus benchmark, achieving pass@1\\nof 66.5% versus 65.9%. In a noteworthy development, Microsoft has introduced the phi-1 model [84],\\na more compact LLM of only 1.3B parameters. Despite its smaller size, phi-1 has been trained on\\nhigh-quality textbook data sourced from the web (comprising 6 billion tokens) and supplemented\\nwith synthetic textbooks and exercises generated with GPT-3.5 (1 billion tokens). It has achieved\\npass@1 of 50.6% on HumanEval and 55.5% on MBPP, setting a new state-of-the-art for Python\\ncoding performance among existing small language models (SLMs). The latest contribution to\\nthis field is from the BigCode team, which has presented StarCoder2-15B-instruct [304], the first\\nentirely self-aligned code LLM trained with a transparent and permissive pipeline. This model\\naligns closely with the OSS-INSTRUCT principles established by Magicoder, generating instructions\\nbased on seed functions filtered from the Stack v1 dataset [132] and producing responses through\\nself-validation. Unlike Magicoder, StarCoder2-15B-instruct employs its base model, StarCoder2-15B,\\nas the data generator, thus avoiding reliance on large and proprietary LLMs like GPT-3.5-turbo\\n[196]. Figure 8 illustrates the comparison between Self-Instruct, Evol-Instruct, and OSS-Instruct\\ndata synthesis methods.\\nWhile synthetic data has demonstrated its potential across both small- and large-scale LMs for a\\nvariety of general and specialized tasks, including code generation, it also poses several challenges\\nthat must be addressed. These challenges include a lack of data diversity [280], the need to ensure\\nthe factuality and fidelity of the information [256, 281], and the potential to amplify existing biases\\nor introduce new ones [24, 89].\\n5.3\\nPre-Training\\n5.3.1\\nModel Architectures.

These architectures are depicted in Figure 2(b) and (c), respectively. For a\\ncomprehensive overview, Table 7 details the encoder-decoder architectures, while Table 8 focuses\\non the decoder-only models utilized in code generation.\\n5.3.2\\nPre-training Tasks. In the initial phase, language models for code generation are typically\\ntrained from scratch using datasets consisting of manually annotated pairs of natural language\\ndescriptions and corresponding code snippets, within a supervised learning framework. However,\\nmanual annotation is not only laborious and time-consuming, but the efficacy of the resulting\\nmodels is also constrained by both the volume and the quality of the available annotated data. This\\nlimitation is especially pronounced in the context of low-resource programming languages, such\\nas Swahili and Yoruba, where annotated examples are scarce [38, 46]. In light of these challenges,\\nthere has been a shift towards an alternative training strategy that involves pre-training models on\\nextensive and unlabelled code corpora. This method is aimed at imbuing the models with a broad\\nunderstanding of programming knowledge, encompassing elements like identifiers, code structure,\\nand underlying semantics [48]. In this regard, two pre-training tasks have gained prominence\\nfor their effectiveness, namely Causal Language Modeling (CLM), also known as unidirectional\\nlanguage modeling or next-token prediction, and Denoising Autoencoding (DAE). The CLM task\\ncan be applied to both decoder-only and encoder-decoder model architectures, while DAE tasks are\\nspecifically designed for encoder-decoder frameworks. It should also be noted that there is a variety\\nof additional auxiliary pre-training tasks that can further enhance model performance. These\\ninclude Masked Identifier Prediction, Identifier Tagging, Bimodal Dual Generation [271], Text-Code\\nMatching, and Text-Code Contrastive Learning [269]. These tasks contribute to a more nuanced\\nand comprehensive pre-training process, equipping the models with the capabilities necessary to\\nhandle a wide range of code generation scenarios.\\nJ.

The conditional probability 𝑃𝜃(𝑥𝑖|x<𝑖)) is modeled by adding a\\ncausal attention mask to the multi-head self-attention matrix of each Transformer block. To be\\nspecific, causal attention masking is implemented by setting the lower triangular part of the\\nmatrix to 0 and the remaining elements to −∞, ensuring that each token 𝑥𝑖attends only to its\\npredecessors and itself. On the contrary, in encoder-decoder LLMs, a pivot token 𝑥𝑘is randomly\\nselected in a sequence of tokens and then regarding the context before it as the source sequence\\nx𝑖𝑛= {𝑥1, . . . ,𝑥𝑘} of the encoder and the sequence after it as the target output x𝑜𝑢𝑡= {𝑥𝑘+1, . . . ,𝑥𝑛}\\nof decoder.

During the inference phase, pre-trained LLMs that have been trained on large-\\nscale code corpus can generate code in a zero-shot manner without the need for fine-tuning. This\\nis achieved through the technique of prompt engineering, which guides the model to produce the\\ndesired output11 [33, 214]. Additionally, recent studies have explored the use of few-shot learning,\\nalso referred to as in-context learning, to enhance model performance further [145, 206].\\nDenoising Autoencoding. In addition to causal language modeling (CLM), the denoising\\nautoencoding (DAE) task has been extensively applied in pre-training encoder-decoder architectures\\nfor code generation, such as PLBART [7], CodeT5 [271], and its enhanced successor, CodeT5+ [269].\\nFollowing T5 [217] and CodeT5 [271], the DAE refers to initially perturbing the source sequence\\nby introducing randomly masked spans of varying lengths. This corrupted sequence serves as the\\ninput for the encoder. Subsequently, the decoder employs an autoregressive strategy to reconstruct\\nthe masked spans, integrating sentinel tokens to facilitate the generation process. This method\\nhas proven effective in improving the model’s ability to generate semantically and syntactically\\naccurate code by learning robust contextual representations [269, 271]. Formally, the denoising\\nautoencoding objective for training encoder-decoder LLMs is to minimize the following likelihood:\\nL𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟−𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟\\n𝐷𝐴𝐸\\n(x) =\\n𝑘\\n∑︁\\n𝑖=1\\n−log 𝑃𝜃(x𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠\\n𝑖\\n| x\\\\𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠, x𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠\\n<𝑖\\n)\\n(18)\\nwhere 𝜃denotes the model parameters, x\\\\𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠is the noisy input with masked spans,\\nx𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠is the masked spans to predict from the decoder with 𝑘denoting the number of\\ntokens in x𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠, and x𝑚𝑎𝑠𝑘𝑒𝑑_𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑠\\n<𝑖\\nis the span sequence autoregressively generated so far.\\nCompared with CLM, the DAE task presents a more challenging scenario, as it necessitates a deeper\\nunderstanding and capture of the intrinsic semantic relationships among token sequences by LLMs\\n[217].\\nJ.

In the case of (E), we utilize a representative RLHF [200] as an example.\\nAdditional reinforcement learning methods, such as DPO [216], are also applicable at this stage.\\n5.4\\nInstruction Tuning\\nAfter pre-training LLMs on large-scale datasets, the next phase typically involves augmenting the\\nmodel’s ability to process and follow various instructions, known as instruction tuning. Instruction\\ntuning generally refers to the supervised fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs using datasets comprised\\nof structured examples framed as various natural language instructions [114, 200, 274, 313]. The\\ncomparison of instruction tuning with various fine-tuning strategies and prompting for code tasks\\nis depicted in Figure 9. Two exemplars of instruction data sampled from Code Alpaca [43] are\\ndemonstrated in Figure 10. It capitalizes on the heterogeneity of instruction types, positioning\\ninstruction tuning as a form of multi-task prompted training that significantly enhances the model’s\\ngeneralization to unseen tasks [56, 200, 229, 274].\\nIn the realm of code generation, natural language descriptions serve as the instructions guiding\\nthe model to generate corresponding code snippets. Consequently, a line of research on instruction\\ntuning LLMs for code generation has garnered substantial interest across academia and industry.\\nTo perform instruction tuning, instruction data are typically compiled from source code with\\npermissive licenses [110, 132, 170] (refer to Section 5.1.2) or are constructed from synthetic code\\ndata [173, 278, 304] (refer to Section 5.2). These datasets are then utilized to fine-tune LLMs through\\na supervised learning paradigm. However, the substantial computational resources required for\\nfull parameter fine-tuning (FFT) LLM pose a notable challenge, particularly in scenarios with\\nconstrained resources [67, 153]. To mitigate this issue, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has\\nemerged as a compelling alternative strategy, gaining increasing attention for its potential to reduce\\nresource consumption [67]. In the following subsection, we categorize existing works based on\\ntheir instruction-tuning strategies to provide a comprehensive and systematic review.\\n11For more information on prompt engineering, visit https://www.promptingguide.ai\\nJ.

The instruction corpus\\nencompasses a variety of tasks, each accompanied by distinct instructions, such as prime numbers generation\\nand URLs extraction.\\n5.4.1\\nFull Parameter Fine-tuning. Full parameter fine-tuning (FFT) involves updating all parameters\\nwithin a pre-trained model, as shown in Figure 11(a). This approach is often preferred when ample\\ncomputational resources and substantial training data are available, as it typically leads to better\\nperformance. [271] introduces an encoder-decoder pre-trained language model for code generation,\\nnamed CodeT5+. They instruction-tune this model on a dataset comprising 20k instruction samples\\nfrom Code Alpaca [43], resulting in an instruction-following model called InstructCodeT5+, which\\nexhibited improved capabilities in code generation. [173] leverages the Evol-Instruct data synthesis\\ntechnique from WizardLM [289] to evolve 20K code Alpaca [43] instruction samples into a 78K\\ncode instruction dataset. This enriched dataset is then used to fine-tune the StarCoder base model,\\nresulting in WizardCoder, which showcases notable advancements in code generation. In a similar\\nvein, inspired by the successes of WizardCoder [173] and RRHF [303], Pangu-Coder 2 [234] applies\\nthe Evol-Instruct method to generate 68k high-quality instruction samples from the initial 20k Code\\nAlpaca [43] instruction samples. Additionally, they introduces a novel reinforcement learning via\\nRank Responses to align Test & Teacher Feedback (RRTF), which further enhances the performance\\nof Pangu-Coder 2 in code generation. Diverging from synthetic instruction data generation methods,\\nOctoPack [187] utilizes real-world data by curating CommitPack from the natural structure of\\nGit commits, which inherently pair code changes with human-written instructions. This dataset,\\nconsisting of 4 terabytes of Git commits across 350 programming languages, is employed to fine-\\ntune StarCoder [147] and CodeGeeX2 [321], leading to the instruction-following code models of\\nOctoCoder and OctoGeeX for code generation, respectively.

To mitigate the extensive computational and resource de-\\nmands inherent in fine-tuning LLMs, the concept of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has\\nemerged to focus on updating a minimal subset of parameters, which may either be a selection of\\nthe model’s parameters or an array of additional parameters specifically introduced for the tuning\\nprocess [67, 153]. The categorization of these methods is depicted in Figure 11(b), (c), and (d). A\\nplethora of innovative PEFT approaches have been developed, among which BitFit [305], Adapter\\n[102], Prompt tuning [142], Prefix-tuning [149], LoRA [103], IA3 [161], QLoRA [65], and AdaLoRA\\n[312] are particularly noteworthy. A seminal study in this field, LoRA [103], proposes a parameter\\nupdate mechanism for a pre-trained weight matrix — such as those found in the key or value\\nprojection matrices of a Transformer block’s multi-head self-attention layer — by factorizing the\\nupdate into two low-rank matrices. Crucially, all original model parameters remain frozen, with\\nonly the pair of low-rank matrices being trainable.

In essence, these methods aim to maximize the likelihood\\nbetween the logarithm of conditional probabilities of preferred and rejected responses, which may\\nbe produced by LLMs with varying capabilities.

Despite this,\\ncrafting an effective prompting as a means of communicating with LLMs to harness their full\\npotential remains a long-standing challenge [164]. Recent advancements in prompting engineering\\nhave expanded the capabilities of LLMs, enabling more sophisticated task completion and enhancing\\nboth reliability and performance. Notable techniques include Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [276], Self-\\nConsistency [267], Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [295], Program of Thoughts (PoT) [50], Reasoning via\\nPlanning (RAP) [93], ReAct [296], Self-Refine [176], Reflexion [236], and LATS [327]. For instance,\\nCoT significantly improves the LLMs’ ability to perform complex reasoning by providing a few\\nchain-of-thought demonstrations as exemplars in prompting.\\nPrompting engineering is particularly advantageous as it bypasses the need for additional training\\nand can significantly elevate performance. Consequently, numerous studies have leveraged this\\ntechnique for iterative and self-improving (refining) code generation within proprietary LLMs\\nsuch as ChatGPT and GPT-4. Figure 12 illustrates the general pipeline for self-improving code\\ngeneration with LLMs. For instance, Self-Debugging [51] involves prompting an LLM to iteratively\\nrefine a predicted program by utilizing feedback composed of code explanations combined with\\nexecution results, which assists in identifying and rectifying errors. When unit tests are unavailable,\\nthis feedback can rely solely on code explanations. Similarly, LDB [325] prompts LLMs to refine\\ngenerated code by incorporating debugging feedback, which consists of the evaluation of the\\ncorrectness of variable values throughout runtime execution, as assessed by the LLMs. In parallel,\\nSelfEvolve [122] employs a two-stage process where LLMs first generate domain-specific knowledge\\nfor a problem, followed by a trial code. This code is then iteratively refined through interactive\\nprompting and execution feedback. An empirical investigation by [195] provides a comprehensive\\nanalysis of the self-repairing capabilities for code generation in models like Code Llama, GPT-\\n3.5, and GPT-4, using problem sets from HumanEval and APPS.

Fortunately, recent advancements in positional\\nencoding techniques, such as ALiBi [211] and RoPE [243], have shown promise in improving the\\nTransformer’s ability to generalize from shorter training sequences to longer inference sequences\\n[318]. This progress addresses the third challenge mentioned above to a certain degree, thereby\\nenabling better contextualization of coding activities within full repositories.\\nTo further refine LLMs for repository-level code completion, several innovative approaches have\\nbeen introduced. RepoCoder [309] leverages a similarity-based retrieval system within an iterative\\nretrieval-generation paradigm to enrich the context and enhance code completion quality. In a\\nsimilar vein, CoCoMIC [69] employs a cross-file context finder named CCFINDER to pinpoint and\\nretrieve the most relevant cross-file contexts within a repository. RepoHyper [209] introduces a\\nsemantic graph structure, termed RSG, to encapsulate the expansive context of code repositories\\nand uses an “Expand and Refine” retrieval method to obtain relevant code snippets. Moreover, a\\nframework known as RLPG [240] has been proposed to generate repository-level prompts that\\nintegrate the repository’s structure with the relevant context across all files. However, the constant\\nreliance on retrieval mechanisms has raised concerns regarding efficiency and robustness, as some\\nretrieved contexts may prove unhelpful or harmful. In response, Repoformer [282] introduces a\\nselective Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that judiciously bypasses retrieval\\nwhen it is deemed redundant. This approach incorporates a self-supervised learning strategy that\\nequips a code LLM with the ability to perform a self-assessment on the utility of retrieval for\\nenhancing the quality of its output, thereby effectively utilizing potentially noisy retrieved contexts.\\nAdditionally, RepoFusion [239] has been developed to train models to combine multiple relevant\\ncontexts from a repository, aiming to produce more precise and context-aware code completions.\\nIn a novel approach, Microsoft’s CodePlan [22] frames repository-level coding tasks as a planning\\nproblem, generating a multi-step chain of edits (plan) where each step involves invoking an LLM on a\\nspecific code location, considering context from the entire repository, preceding code modifications,\\nand task-specific instructions.\\nAdvancing the state-of-the-art, [308] tackles the formidable challenge of NL2Repo, an endeavor\\nthat seeks to create a complete code repository from natural language requirements. To address\\nthis complex task, they introduce the CodeS framework, which strategically breaks down NL2Repo\\ninto a series of manageable sub-tasks using a multi-layer sketch approach. The CodeS framework\\ncomprises three distinct modules: 1) RepoSketcher, for creating a directory structure of the reposi-\\ntory based on given requirements; 2) FileSketcher, for sketching out each file within that structure;\\nand 3) SketchFiller, for fleshing out the specifics of each function within the file sketches [308].\\nAccordingly, a surge of benchmarks tailored for repository-level code generation has emerged,\\nsuch as RepoEval [309], Stack-Repo [239], Repobench [167], EvoCodeBench [144], SWE-bench\\n[123], CrossCodeEval [68], and SketchEval [308]. The detailed statistics and comparisons of these\\nbenchmarks are presented in Table 6.\\nDespite the progress made by these methods in repository-level code generation, significant chal-\\nlenges remain to be addressed.

Then,\\nit incorporates an active retrieval strategy that iteratively refines the query and enriches the\\nknowledge soup, expanding the scope of information available for code generation.\\nDespite these advancements, several limitations in retrieval-augmented code generation warrant\\nfurther exploration: 1) the quality of the retrieved information significantly impacts overall perfor-\\nmance; 2) the effective integration of retrieved code information with the query needs optimization;\\n3) an over-reliance on retrieved information may lead to inadequate responses that fail to address\\nthe query’s intent; 4) additional retrieved information necessitates larger context windows for the\\nLLM, resulting in increased computational demands.\\n5.9\\nAutonomous Coding Agents\\nThe advent of LLMs has marked the beginning of a new era of potential pathways toward artificial\\ngeneral intelligence (AGI), capturing significant attention in both academia and industry [108, 261,\\n279, 284]. A rapidly expanding array of applications for LLM-based autonomous agents, including\\nAutoGPT [2], AgentGPT [1], BabyAGI [3], and AutoGen [283], underlines the promise of this\\ntechnology.\\nLLM-powered autonomous agents are systems endowed with sophisticated reasoning abilities,\\nleveraging an LLM as a central computational engine or controller. This allows them to formulate\\nand execute problem-solving plans through a series of tool-enabled functions or API calls. Moreover,\\nthese agents are designed to function within a shared environment where they can communicate\\nand engage in cooperative, competitive, or negotiating interactions [104, 261, 283]. The typical\\narchitecture of such an agent encompasses an LLM-based Agent, a memory module, a planning\\ncomponent, and a tool utilization module, as depicted in Figure 14.\\nIn the realm of automated code generation, LLM-powered autonomous agents have demon-\\nstrated remarkable proficiency. For instance, AgentCoder [104] achieved a groundbreaking pass@1\\nof 96.3% on the HumanEval benchmark, forwarding a step closer to the future of automated soft-\\nware development [111].

Additionally, AutoCodeRover [316]\\nis proposed to autonomously resolve GitHub issues for program enhancement.\\nTo address the complexity of tasks within software engineering, two innovative autonomous AI\\nsoftware engineers Devin14[61] and OpenDevin15[199], have been released and rapidly garnered\\nconsiderable interest within the software engineering (SE) and artificial general intelligence (AGI)\\ncommunity. Subsequently, an autonomous system, SWE-agent [124], leverages a language model\\nto interact with a computer to address software engineering tasks, successfully resolving 12.5% of\\nissues on the SWE-bench benchmark [123]. L2MAC [98] has been introduced as the first practical,\\nLLM-based, multi-agent, general-purpose stored-program automatic computer that utilizes a von\\nNeumann architecture, designed specifically for the generation of long and consistent outputs.\\nAt the time of writing this survey, OpenDevin has enhanced CodeAct with bash command-based\\ntools, leading to the release of OpenDevin CodeAct 1.0 [287], which sets a new state-of-the-art\\nperformance on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark [123].\\nDespite these remarkable advancements, the journey toward fully realized AI software engineers\\nemploying LLM-powered autonomous agents is far from complete [261, 284]. Critical aspects\\nsuch as prompt design, context length, agent count, and toolsets call for further refinement and\\noptimization, especially as problem complexities escalate [111].\\n5.10\\nEvaluation\\nDespite the impressive capabilities of LLMs, they exhibit a range of behaviors that are both beneficial\\nand potentially risky. These behaviors can enhance performance across various downstream tasks\\nbut may also introduce reliability and trustworthiness concerns in LLM deployment [42, 48, 290].\\nConsequently, it is imperative to develop precise evaluation approaches to discern the qualitative\\nand quantitive differences between models, thereby encouraging further advancements in LLM\\ncapabilities.\\nEvaluation strategies for LLMs in code generation mirror those for general-purpose LLMs and\\ncan be divided into three principal categories: metrics-based, human-centered, and LLM-based\\napproaches. Detailed benchmarks for these evaluation strategies are presented in Section 5.1.3 and\\nsummarized in Table 6. Subsequent subsections will provide a thorough analysis of each approach.\\n5.10.1\\nMetrics. The pursuit of effective and reliable automatic evaluation metrics for generated\\ncontent is a long-standing challenge within the field of natural language processing (NLP) [49, 156,\\n203]. At the early stage, most works directly leverage token-matching-based metrics, such as Exact\\nMatch, BLEU [203], ROUGE [156], and METEOR [23], which are prevalent in text generation of\\nNLP, to assess the quality of code generation.\\nWhile these metrics offer a rapid and cost-effective approach for assessing the quality of gener-\\nated code, they often fall short of capturing the syntactical and functional correctness, as well as\\nthe semantic features of the code. To eliminate this limitation, CodeBLEU [221] was introduced, en-\\nhancing the traditional BLEU metric [203] by incorporating syntactic information through abstract\\nsyntax trees (AST) and semantic understanding via data-flow graph (DFG). Despite these improve-\\nments, the metric does not fully resolve issues pertaining to execution errors or discrepancies in\\nthe execution results of the generated code. In light of these challenges, execution-based metrics\\nhave gained prominence for evaluating code generation, including pass@k [48], n@k [151], test\\n14https://www.cognition.ai/introducing-devin\\n15https://github.com/OpenDevin/OpenDevin\\nJ.

Furthermore, in\\nscenarios lacking a ground truth label, unsupervised metrics such as perplexity (PPL) [116] can\\nserve as evaluative tools. Perplexity quantifies an LLM’s uncertainty in predicting new content,\\nthus providing an indirect measure of the model’s generalization capabilities and the quality of the\\ngenerated code.\\nTaken together, while the aforementioned methods primarily focus on the functional correctness\\nof code, they do not provide a holistic evaluation that encompasses other critical dimensions such\\nas code vulnerability [189], maintainability [15], readability [34], complexity and efficiency [208],\\nstylistic consistency [178], and execution stability [215].

Given the intrinsic characteristics of code, the aforementioned automatic\\nevaluation metrics are inherently limited in their capacity to fully assess code quality. For instance,\\nmetrics specifically designed to measure code style consistency are challenging to develop and\\noften fail to capture this aspect adequately [44]. When it comes to repository-level code generation,\\nthe evaluation of overall code quality is substantially complicated due to the larger scale of the\\ntask, which involves cross-file designs and intricate internal as well as external dependencies, as\\ndiscussed by [22, 239].\\nTo overcome these challenges, conducting human evaluations becomes necessary, as it yields\\nrelatively robust and reliable results. Human assessments also offer greater adaptability across\\nvarious tasks, enabling the simplification of complex and multi-step evaluations. Moreover, human\\nevaluations are essential for demonstrating the effectiveness of certain token-matching-based\\nmetrics, such as CodeBLEU [221]. These studies typically conduct experiments to evaluate the\\ncorrelation coefficient between proposed metrics and quality scores assigned by actual users,\\ndemonstrating their superiority over existing metrics.\\nMoreover, in an effort to better align LLMs with human preferences and intentions, InstructGPT\\n[200] employs human-written prompts and demonstrations, and model output ranking in the\\nfine-tuning of LLMs using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Although similar\\nalignment learning techniques have been applied to code generation, the feedback in this domain\\ntypically comes from a compiler or interpreter, which offers execution feedback, rather than from\\nhuman evaluators. Notable examples include CodeRL [139], PPOCoder [238], RLTF [163], and\\nPanGu-Coder2 [234]. Further information on this topic is available in Section 5.5.\\nNonetheless, human evaluations are not without drawbacks, as they can be prone to certain\\nissues that may compromise their accuracy and consistency.

The powerful instruction-following capabilities of LLMs have stimulated\\nresearchers to innovatively investigate the potential of LLM-based evaluations. The LLM-as-a-Judge\\n[320] refers to the application of advanced proprietary LLMs (e.g., GPT4, Gemini, and Claud 3)\\nas proxies for human evaluators. This involves designing prompts with specific requirements\\nto guide LLMs in conducting evaluations, as demonstrated by AlpacaEval [148] and MT-bench\\n[320]. This method reduces reliance on human participation, thereby facilitating more efficient\\nand scalable evaluations. Moreover, LLMs can offer insightful explanations for the assigned rating\\nscores, thereby augmenting the interpretability of evaluations [319].\\nNevertheless, the use of LLM-based evaluation for code generation remains relatively underex-\\nplored compared with general-purpose LLM. The pipeline of (Code) LLM-as-a-judge for evaluating\\ngenerated code by Code LLMs is depicted in Figure 16. A recent work [332] introduces the ICE-Score\\nevaluation metric, which instructs LLM for code assessments. This approach attains superior corre-\\nlations with functional correctness and human preferences, thereby eliminating the requirement\\nfor test oracles or references. As the capabilities of LLM continue to improve, we anticipate seeing\\nmore research in this direction.\\nDespite their scalability and explainability, the effectiveness of LLM-based evaluation is con-\\nstrained by the inherent limitations of the chosen LLM. Several studies have shown that most LLMs,\\nincluding GPT-4, suffer from several issues, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement\\nbiases, as well as restricted reasoning ability [320]. Specifically, position bias refers to the tendency\\nof LLMs to disproportionately favor responses that are presented in certain positions, which can\\nskew the perceived quality of answers based on their order of presentation.

Self-enhancement bias, on the other\\nhand, is observed when LLMs consistently overvalue the quality of the text they generate [319, 320].\\nMoreover, due to their inherent limitations in tackling complex reasoning challenges, LLMs may not\\nbe entirely reliable as evaluators for tasks that require intensive reasoning, such as those involving\\nmathematical problem-solving. However, these shortcomings can be partially addressed through\\nthe application of deliberate prompt engineering and fine-tuning techniques, as suggested by [320].\\n5.10.4\\nEmpirical Comparison. In this section, we present a performance comparison of LLMs for\\ncode generation using the well-regarded HumanEval, MBPP, and the more practical and chal-\\nlenging BigCodeBench benchmarks. This empirical comparison aims to highlight the progressive\\nenhancements in LLM capabilities for code generation. These benchmarks assess an LLM’s ability to\\ngenerate source code across various levels of difficulty and types of programming tasks. Specifically,\\nHumanEval focuses on complex code generation, MBPP targets basic programming tasks, and\\nBigCodeBench emphasizes practical and challenging programming tasks.\\nDue to the limitations in computational resources we faced, we have cited experimental results\\nfrom original papers or widely recognized open-source leaderboards within the research community,\\nsuch as the HumanEval Leaderboard 16, EvalPlus Leaderboard 17, Big Code Models Leaderboard\\n18, and BigCodeBench Leaderboard 19.

For models with various sizes, we report only the largest size version of each model\\nwith a magnitude of B parameters.\\n• The performance gap between open-source and closed-source models across the three bench-\\nmarks is gradually narrowing. For instance, on the HumanEval benchmark, DeepSeek-Coder-\\nV2-Instruct with 21B activation parameters and Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 7B achieve 90% and\\n88.4% pass@1, respectively. These results are comparable to the much larger closed-source\\nLLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet, which achieves 92.0% pass@1. On the MBPP benchmark,\\nQwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 7B with 83.5% pass@1 significantly outperforms GPT-3.5-Turbo\\nwith 52.2% pass@1 and closely rivals the closed-source Claude-3-Opus with 86.4% pass@1.\\nOn the BigCodeBench, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct achieves 59.7%, surpassing all compared\\nclosed-source and open-source LLMs except for slightly falling behind GPT-4o-0513, which\\nachieves 61.1%.\\n• Generally, as the number of model parameters increases, the performance of code LLMs\\nimproves. However, Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 7B achieves 88.4% pass@1, outperforming larger\\nmodels like StarCoder2-Instruct 15.5B with 72.6% pass@1, DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct 33B\\nwith 79.3% pass@1, and Code Llama-Instruct 70B with 67.8% pass@1 on the HumanEval\\nbenchmark.

However, MBPP, which\\ninvolves basic programming tasks, and BigCodeBench, which involves more practical and\\nchallenging programming tasks, demand more capable code LLMs. Additionally, while these\\nbenchmarks primarily evaluate the functional correctness of code, they do not provide\\na comprehensive assessment across other critical dimensions. Developing a more holistic\\nevaluation framework that integrates various aspects remains an open area for future research\\nand development in LLMs for code generation evaluation.\\nDiscussion: We discuss certain code LLMs in Table 9 for clarity: (1) General LLMs accessed via\\nAPI are not specifically trained on large code corpora but achieve state-of-the-art performance\\nin code generation, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet with 92.0% pass@1 on HumanEval benchmark.\\n(2) AlphaCode targets code generation for more complex and unseen problems that require a\\ndeep understanding of algorithms and intricate natural language, such as those encountered in\\ncompetitive programming. The authors of AlphaCode found that large-scale model sampling to\\nnavigate the search space, such as 1M samples per problem for CodeContests, followed by filtering\\nbased on program behavior to produce a smaller set of submissions, is crucial for achieving good and\\nreliable performance on problems that necessitate advanced reasoning. (3) Phi-1 1.3B is a specialized\\nLLM for code, trained on “textbook quality” data from the web (6B tokens) and synthetically\\ngenerated textbooks and exercises using GPT-3.5 (1B tokens). (4) Code Llama 70B is initialized with\\nLlama 2 model weights and continually pre-trained on 1T tokens from a code-heavy dataset and\\nlong-context fine-tuned with approximately 20B tokens. However, Code Llama-Instruct 70B is fine-\\ntuned from Code Llama-Python 70B without long-context fine-tuning, using an additional 260M\\ntokens to better follow human instructions. Surprisingly, these models underperform compared to\\nsmaller parameter Code LLMs like Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct 7B, DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Instruct 21B,\\nand Codestral 22B across all three benchmarks. The underlying reasons for this discrepancy remain\\nunclear and warrant further exploration. (5) Unlike other open-source Code LLMs, DeepSeek-Coder-\\nV2-Instruct is further pre-trained on DeepSeek-V2 [159], which employs a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)\\narchitecture with only 21B activation parameters out of 236B parameters, using an additional 6\\ntrillion tokens composed of 60% source code, 10% math corpus, and 30% natural language corpus.\\nFor a comprehensive understanding of MoE in LLMs, please refer to [36].\\n5.11\\nCode LLMs Alignment\\nThe pre-training of LLMs for next-token prediction, aimed at maximizing conditional generation\\nlikelihood across vast textual corpora, equips these models with extensive world knowledge and\\nemergent capabilities [33].

Nonetheless, LLMs can sometimes misinterpret human\\ninstructions, produce biased content, or generate factually incorrect information (commonly referred\\nto as hallucinations), which may limit their practical utility [118, 272, 319].\\nAligning LLMs with human intentions and values, known as LLM alignment, has consequently\\nbecome a critical research focus [118, 272]. Key objectives frequently discussed in the context of LLM\\nalignment include robustness, interpretability, controllability, ethicality, trustworthiness, security,\\nprivacy, fairness, and safety. In recent years, significant efforts have been made by researchers\\nto achieve this alignment, employing techniques such as Reinforcement Learning with Human\\nFeedback (RLHF) [200].\\nHowever, the alignment of Code LLMs has not been extensively explored. Compared to text\\ngeneration, aligning code generation with human intentions and values is even more crucial. For\\ninstance, users without programming expertise might prompt Code LLM to generate source code\\nand subsequently execute it on their computers, potentially causing catastrophic damage. Some\\npotential risks include:\\n• Malware Infection: The code could contain viruses, worms, or trojans that compromise our\\nsystem’s security.\\n• Data Loss: It might delete or corrupt important files and data.\\n• Unauthorized Access: It can create backdoors, allowing attackers to access our system\\nremotely.\\n• Performance Issues: The code might consume excessive resources, slowing down our\\nsystem.\\n• Privacy Breaches: Sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, might be\\nstolen.\\n• System Damage: It may alter system settings or damage hardware components.\\n• Network Spread: It could propagate across networks, affecting other devices.\\n• Financial Loss: If the code is ransomware, it might encrypt data and demand payment for\\ndecryption.\\n• Legal Consequences: Running certain types of malicious code can lead to legal repercus-\\nsions.\\nAs illustrated, aligning Code LLMs to produce source code consistent with human preferences and\\nvalues is of paramount importance in software development. A recent study [293] provides the first\\nsystematic literature review identifying seven critical non-functional properties of LLMs for code,\\nbeyond accuracy, including robustness, security, privacy, explainability, efficiency, and usability.\\nThis study is highly pertinent to the alignment of Code LLMs. We recommend readers refer to this\\nsurvey for more detailed insights.\\nIn this survey, we identify five core principles that serve as the key objectives for aligning Code\\nLLMs: Green, Responsibility, Efficiency, Safety, and Trustworthiness (collectively referred to as\\nGREST). These principles are examined from a broader perspective. Each category encompasses\\nvarious concepts and properties, which are summarized in Table 11.

This involves optimizing energy\\nconsumption and reducing both the carbon footprint and financial costs associated with training\\nand inference processes. Currently, training, inference, and deployment of Code LLMs are notably\\nresource-intensive. For example, training GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, required the\\nequivalent of 355 years of single-processor computing time and consumed 284,000 kWh of energy,\\nresulting in an estimated 552.1 tons of CO2 emissions [228].

To mitigate these costs, several techniques are often employed, such as the development of\\nspecialized hardware (e.g., Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Neural Processing Units (NPUs)),\\nmodel compression methods (e.g., quantization and knowledge distillation), parameter-efficient\\nfine-tuning (PEFT), and the use of renewable energy sources. For instance, Shi et al. [235] applied\\nknowledge distillation to reduce the size of CodeBERT [76] and GraphCodeBERT [86], resulting in\\noptimized models of just 3MB. These models are 160 times smaller than the original large models\\nand significantly reduce energy consumption by up to 184 times and carbon footprint by up to 157\\ntimes. Similarly, Wei et al. [277] utilized quantization techniques for Code LLMs such as CodeGen\\n[193] and Incoder [77] by employing lower-bit integers (e.g., int8). This approach reduced storage\\nrequirements by 67.3% to 70.8%, carbon footprint by 28.8% to 55.0%, and pricing costs by 28.9% to\\n55.0%.\\nResponsibility: The Responsibility principle in the context of Code LLMs underscores the\\nimportance of ethical considerations, fairness, and accountability throughout their lifecycle. This\\ninvolves addressing biases in training data, ensuring fairness and transparency in model decision-\\nmaking, maintaining accountability for outputs, adhering to applicable laws (e.g., copyright),\\nimplementing safeguards against misuse, and providing clear communication about the model’s\\ncapabilities and limitations.

Biases in code generation can lead to flawed software and reinforce stereo-\\ntypes, potentially causing significant societal impacts. For example, an Code LLM that in-\\nherits biases from its training data may produce source code/software that inadvertently\\ndiscriminates against certain user groups. This can result in applications that fail to meet the\\ndiverse needs of users, promoting exclusionary practices and reinforcing existing stereotypes\\n[168, 185].\\n• Fairness and Transparency. A lack of fairness and transparency in Code LLM decision-making\\ncan result in biased or suboptimal code solutions. If the model’s decision-making process is\\nopaque, developers might unknowingly introduce code that favors specific frameworks or\\nlibraries, thereby limiting innovation and diversity in software development. This opacity\\ncan create unfair advantages and hinder collaborative efforts within tech communities [31].\\n• Legal Compliance. Compliance with relevant laws, such as licensing and copyright, is crucial\\nwhen using Code LLMs for code generation to avoid legal complications. If an Code LLM\\ngenerates code snippets that inadvertently infringe on existing copyrights, it can lead to\\nlegal disputes and financial liabilities for developers and organizations [292]. Such risks may\\ndiscourage the use of advanced AI tools, thus stifling innovation and affecting growth and\\ncollaboration within the tech community.\\n• Accountability. Without accountability for code generated by Code LLMs, addressing bugs\\nor security vulnerabilities becomes challenging. If a model generates faulty code leading to\\na security breach, the absence of clear accountability can result in significant financial and\\nreputational damage for companies. This uncertainty can delay critical issue resolution and\\nimpede trust in AI-assisted development [155].\\n• Misuse Prevention. Failing to implement mechanisms to prevent the misuse of Code LLMs can\\nenable the creation of harmful software. For example, models could be exploited to generate\\nmalware or unauthorized scripts, posing cybersecurity risks. Without proper safeguards,\\nthese models can facilitate malicious activities, threatening both individual and organizational\\nsecurity [184].\\n• Clear Communication. Without clear communication about a model’s capabilities and limita-\\ntions, developers may misuse the model or overestimate its abilities. Relying on the model\\nto generate complex, mission-critical code without human oversight can lead to significant\\nsoftware failures. Misunderstanding its limitations can result in faulty implementations and\\nlost productivity [226].\\nTo adhere to this principle, potential mitigation methods include bias detection and mitigation,\\nquantification and evaluation, and adherence to ethical guidelines. Liu et al. [168] propose a new\\nparadigm for constructing code prompts, successfully uncovering social biases in code generation\\nmodels, and developing a dataset along with three metrics to evaluate overall social bias. Recently,\\nXu et al. [292] introduced LiCoEval, an evaluation benchmark for assessing the license compliance\\ncapabilities of LLMs. Additionally, incorporating diverse perspectives in development teams and\\nengaging with stakeholders from various communities can further align Code LLM outputs with\\nethical standards and societal values.\\nEfficiency: The Efficiency principle emphasizes optimizing the performance and speed of Code\\nLLMs for code generation while minimizing the computational resources required for training\\nand inference. For instance, training the GPT-3 model, which consists of 175 billion parameters,\\ndemands substantial resources. It requires approximately 1,024 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, costing around\\n4.6 million and taking approximately 34 days to complete the training process.

For a comprehensive and detailed discussion on methods\\nto enhance the efficiency of Code LLMs for code generation, please refer to Section 4.5.2, “Efficiency\\nEnhancement”, in [293].\\nSafety: The Safety principle of Code LLMs is of utmost importance due to their potential\\nto introduce vulnerabilities, errors, or privacy breaches into software systems. Ensuring safety\\ninvolves comprehensive testing and validation processes to detect and mitigate these risks. For\\ninstance, attackers might compromise the training process of LLMs by injecting malicious examples\\ninto the training data, a method known as data poisoning attacks [231]. Even when attackers\\nlack access to the training process, they may employ techniques like the black-box inversion\\napproach introduced by Hajipour et al. [91]. This method uses few-shot prompting to identify\\nprompts that coax black-box code generation models into producing vulnerable code. Furthermore,\\nYang et al. [294] and Al-Kaswan et al. [8] reveals that Code LLMs, such as CodeParrot [73], can\\nmemorize training data, potentially outputting personally identifiable information like emails,\\nnames, and IP addresses, thereby posing significant privacy risks. Additionally, Yuan et al. [302]\\ndemonstrate that engaging with ChatGPT and GPT-4 in non-natural languages can circumvent\\nsafety alignment measures, leading to unsafe outcomes, such as “The steps involved in stealing\\nmoney from a bank.”. To bolster the safety of LLMs in code generation, it is crucial to detect and\\neliminate privacy-related information from training datasets. For example, approaches outlined in\\n[77] and [9] utilize carefully crafted regular expressions to identify and remove private information\\nfrom training data. To counteract black-box inversion, implementing prompt filtering mechanisms\\nis recommended to identify and block prompts that might result in insecure code generation.\\nMoreover, adversarial training can enhance the model’s resilience to malicious prompts. Employing\\nreinforcement learning methods can further align Code LLMs with human preferences, thereby\\nreducing the likelihood of producing harmful outputs.\\nTrustworthiness: The Trustworthiness principle focuses on developing Code LLMs that users\\ncan depend on for accurate and reliable code generation, which is crucial for their acceptance and\\nwidespread adoption. Achieving this requires ensuring model transparency, providing explanations\\nfor decisions, and maintaining consistent performance across various scenarios. For instance,\\nJi et al. [120] propose a causal graph-based representation of prompts and generated code to\\nidentify the causal relationships between them. This approach offers insights into the effectiveness\\nof Code LLMs and assists end-users in understanding the generation. Similarly, Palacio et al.\\n[202] introduce ASTxplainer, a tool that extracts and aggregates normalized model logits within\\nAbstract Syntax Tree (AST) structures. This alignment of token predictions with AST nodes\\nprovides visualizations that enhance end-user understanding of Code LLM predictions. Therefore,\\nby prioritizing trustworthiness, we can bolster user confidence and facilitate the integration of\\nCode LLMs into diverse coding environments. By adhering to the aforementioned principles as key\\nobjectives for aligning Code LLMs, researchers and developers can create LLMs for code generation\\nthat are not only capable but also ethical, sustainable, and user-centric.\\n5.12\\nApplications\\nCode LLMs have been integrated with development tools and platforms, such as integrated de-\\nvelopment environments (IDEs) and version control systems, improving programming efficiency\\nsubstantially.

Despite this promising progress, there are still numerous\\nchallenges that need to be addressed. These challenges are mainly caused by the gap between\\nacademia and practical development. For example, in academia, the HumanEval benchmark has\\nbeen established as a de facto standard for evaluating the coding proficiency of LLMs. However,\\nmany works have illustrated the evaluation of HumanEval can’t reflect the scenario of practical\\ndevelopment [68, 72, 123, 162]. In contrast, these serious challenges offer substantial opportunities\\nfor further research and applications. In this section, we pinpoint critical challenges and identify\\npromising opportunities, aiming to bridge the research-practicality divide.\\nEnhancing complex code generation at repository and software scale. In practical de-\\nvelopment scenarios, it often involves a large number of complex programming problems of\\nvarying difficulty levels [151, 311]. While LLMs have shown proficiency in generating function-\\nlevel code snippets, these models often struggle with more complex, unseen programming problems,\\nrepository- and software-level problems that are commonplace in real-world software develop-\\nment. To this end, it requires strong problem-solving skills in LLM beyond simply functional-level\\ncode generation. For example, AlphaCode [151] achieved an average ranking in the top 54.3% in\\nprogramming competitions where an understanding of algorithms and complex natural language is\\nrequired to solve competitive programming problems. [123] argues that existing LLMs can’t resolve\\nreal-world GitHub issues well since the best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere\\n1.96% of the issues. The reason for poor performance is mainly attributed to the weak reasoning\\ncapabilities [105], complex internal- and external- dependencies [22], and context length limitation\\nof LLMs [22]. Therefore, the pursuit of models that can handle more complex, repository- and\\nsoftware-level code generation opens up new avenues for automation in software development\\nand makes programming more productive and accessible.\\nInnovating model architectures tuned to code structures. Due to their scalability and effec-\\ntiveness, Transformer-based LLM architectures have become dominant in solving code generation\\ntask. Nevertheless, they might not be optimally designed to capture the inherent structure and\\nsyntax of programming languages (PLs) [85, 86, 134, 175]. Code has a highly structured nature,\\nwith a syntax that is more rigid than natural language. This presents a unique challenge for LLMs,\\nwhich are often derived from models that were originally designed for natural language processing\\n(NLP). The development of novel model architectures that inherently understand and integrate the\\nstructural properties of code represents a significant opportunity to improve code generation and\\ncomprehension. Innovations such as tree-based neural networks [183], which mirror the abstract\\nsyntax tree (AST) representation of code, can offer a more natural way for models to learn and\\ngenerate programming languages. Additionally, leveraging techniques from the compiler theory,\\nsuch as intermediate representations (IR) [152], could enable models to operate on a more abstract\\nand generalizable level, making them effective across multiple programming languages [207]. By\\nexploring architectures beyond the traditional sequential models, researchers can unlock new\\npotentials in code generation.\\nCurating high-quality code data for pre-training and fine-tuning of LLMs. The efficacy\\nof LLMs largely depends on the quality and diversity of code datasets used during pre-training and\\nfine-tuning phases [133, 280, 328]. Currently, there is a scarcity of large, high-quality datasets that\\nencompass a wide range of programming tasks, styles, and languages. This limitation constrains the\\nJ.

The development of more sophisticated data acquisition\\ntechniques, such as automated code repositories mining [158], advanced filtering algorithms, and\\ncode data synthesis [165] (see Section 5.2), can lead to the creation of richer datasets. Collaborations\\nwith industry partners (e.g., GitHub) could also facilitate access to proprietary codebases, thereby\\nenhancing the practical relevance of the training material. Furthermore, the adoption of open-source\\nmodels for dataset sharing can accelerate the collective effort to improve the breadth and depth of\\ncode data available for LLM research.\\nDeveloping comprehensive benchmarks and metrics for coding proficiency evaluation\\nin LLMs. Current benchmarks like HumanEval may not capture the full spectrum of coding\\nskills required for practical software development [191]. Additionally, metrics often focus on\\nsyntactic correctness or functional accuracy, neglecting aspects such as code efficiency [208],\\nstyle [44], readability [34], or maintainability [15]. The design of comprehensive benchmarks that\\nsimulate real-world software development challenges could provide a more accurate assessment\\nof LLMs’ coding capabilities. These benchmarks should include diverse programming tasks of\\nvarying difficulty levels, such as debugging [325], refactoring [237], and optimization [112], and\\nshould be complemented by metrics that evaluate qualitative aspects of code. The establishment of\\ncommunity-driven benchmarking platforms could facilitate continuous evaluation and comparison\\nof LLMs for code generation across the industry and academia.\\nSupport for low-resource, low-level, and domain-specific programming languages. LLMs\\nare predominantly trained in popular high-level programming languages, leaving low-resource, low-\\nlevel, and domain-specific languages underrepresented. This lack of focus restricts the applicability\\nof LLMs in certain specialized fields and systems programming [250]. Intensifying research on\\ntransfer learning and meta-learning approaches may enable LLMs to leverage knowledge from\\nhigh-resource languages to enhance their performance on less common ones [38, 46]. Additionally,\\npartnerships with domain experts can guide the creation of targeted datasets and fine-tuning\\nstrategies to better serve niche markets. The development of LLMs with a capacity for multilingual\\ncode generation also presents a significant opportunity for broadening the scope of applications.\\nContinuous learning for LLMs to keep pace with evolving coding knowledge. The\\nsoftware development landscape is continuously evolving, with new languages, frameworks, and\\nbest practices emerging regularly. LLMs risk becoming outdated if they cannot adapt to these\\nchanges and incorporate the latest programming knowledge [115, 264]. While retrieval augmented\\ncode generation mitigates these issues, the performance is limited by the quality of the retrieval\\ncontext While retrieval-augmented code generation offers a partial solution to these issues, its\\neffectiveness is inherently constrained by the quality of retrieved context. [171, 309, 330]. Therefore,\\nestablishing mechanisms for continuous learning and updating of LLMs can help maintain their\\nrelevance over time. This could involve real-time monitoring of code repositories to identify trends\\nand innovations, as well as the creation of incremental learning systems that can assimilate new\\ninformation without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Engaging the LLMs in active\\nlearning scenarios where they interact with human developers may also foster ongoing knowledge\\nacquisition.\\nEnsuring code safety and aligning LLM outputs with human coding preferences. Ensuring\\nthe safety and security of code generated by LLMs is a paramount concern, as is their ability to\\nalign with human preferences and ethical standards. Current models may inadvertently introduce\\nvulnerabilities or generate code that does not adhere to desired norms [48, 293]. Research into\\nthe integration of formal verification tools within the LLM pipeline can enhance the safety of the\\nproduced code. Additionally, developing frameworks for alignment learning that capture and reflect\\nhuman ethical preferences can ensure that the code generation process aligns with societal values\\nJ.

We hope this survey can contribute to a compre-\\nhensive and systematic overview of LLM for code generation and promote its thriving evolution.\\nWe optimistically believe that LLM will ultimately change all aspects of coding and automatically\\nwrite safe, helpful, accurate, trustworthy, and controllable code, like professional programmers,\\nand even solve coding problems that currently cannot be solved by humans.\\nREFERENCES\\n[1] 2023.

A key PBE strategy has been to restrict the search to a carefully designed small\\ndomain-specific language (DSL) with effectively-invertible (EI) operators at the top and effectively-enumerable\\n(EE) operators at the bottom. This facilitates an effective combination of top-down synthesis strategy (which\\nbackpropagates outputs over various paths in the DSL using inverse functions) with a bottom-up synthesis\\nstrategy (which propagates inputs over various paths in the DSL). We address the problem of scaling synthesis\\nto large DSLs with several non-EI/EE operators. This is motivated by the need to support a richer class of\\ntransformations and the need for readable code generation. We propose a novel solution strategy that relies\\non propagating fewer values and over fewer paths.\\nOur first key idea is that of cut functions that prune the set of values being propagated by using knowledge\\nof the sub-DSL on the other side. Cuts can be designed to preserve completeness of synthesis; however, DSL\\ndesigners may use incomplete cuts to have finer control over the kind of programs synthesized. In either case,\\ncuts make search feasible for non-EI/EE operators and efficient for deep DSLs.

This makes search efficient over grammars with large fanouts without losing recall. It also\\nmakes ranking simpler yet more effective in learning an intended program from very few examples.

A variety of approaches have been proposed targeting various applications. Starting\\nfrom purely symbolic techniques, the field has explored neural [Devlin et al. 2017] and neurosym-\\nbolic approaches [Chaudhuri et al. 2021; Kalyan et al. 2018; Rahmani et al. 2021; Verbruggen et al.\\n2021]. In this paper, we present novel symbolic techniques to improve the scalability of PBE systems.\\nPBE applications range from enabling non-experts to author programs for spreadsheet data\\nmanipulation [Gulwani et al. 2012] or application creation in a low-code/no-code setting [Lukes\\net al. 2021], to improving productivity of data scientists for data wrangling tasks [Le and Gulwani\\n2014; Miltner et al. 2018] and even automating professional developers’ repeated edits [Pan et al.\\n2021; Rolim et al. 2017]. A flagship application for PBE is that of string transformations, for\\ninstance, converting ‘Alan Turing’ to ‘turing, alan’—such tasks are very common and are\\nwell described by examples [Gulwani 2011]. We focus on such string transformations, though our\\ntechnical contributions are more generally applicable to any grammar-based synthesis setting.\\nMost PBE engines work by defining a program search space, and then employing some strategy\\nto search over it. The program space is often defined by a domain-specific language (DSL), which\\nfixes a finite set of operators and all the different ways they can be composed to create programs. A\\nkey challenge in PBE is scaling the search to very large program spaces. DSL designers have to\\nbuild DSLs that are expressive enough to be useful, yet small enough to keep the program search\\nspace small. This tension in DSL design has hindered broader applications of program synthesis.\\nUsers implicitly advocate for larger DSLs as they want synthesizers to produce programs that are\\ncloser to the ones they would manually write, i.e., ones that use a large variety of functions that\\nare available in general purpose programming languages. On the other hand, these larger DSLs\\n(a) make the search space large and the synthesis slow, and (b) more importantly, allow the large\\nnumber of functions to be combined in unintuitive ways to produce undesirable programs. Program\\nsynthesis research has mainly focused on completeness, i.e., ensuring that we find a program when\\none exists, and insisting on completeness for large DSLs exacerbates these problems. We introduce\\ntwo new mechanisms, cuts and precedence, by which DSL designers can control the program search\\nspace even as the DSL itself grows in size. This not only eases the job of the DSL designer, but also\\nenables them to build synthesizers based on very expressive DSLs.\\nChallenges. Let us say we are given an input-output example: a tuple of input values and one\\noutput value. There are two commonly used search strategies to find programs that would generate\\nthe output value using the input values: bottom-up and top-down.\\nBottom-up (BU) search starts with the inputs and generates all possible values that can be computed\\nfrom the inputs using all possible (partial) programs in the search space. It does so by applying the\\nexecutable semantics functions of the DSL operators. Thus, information flows from the inputs, and all\\ncomputed intermediate results are completely oblivious to the output. The BU strategy is effective\\nonly when the sets of values generated in each intermediate stage remains small. This happens\\nwhen there are only a small number of leaf constants and each operator is effectively-enumerable\\n(EE) – namely, it has a small arity and many-to-one semantics, thus having a small dynamic fan-out.\\nProc.

Thus,\\ninformation flows from the output value, and at every stage, the intermediate values are computed\\nsolely based on the output and are completely oblivious to the input values. The TD strategy is\\neffective only when these intermediate sets are small. This happens only when every operator is\\neffectively invertible (EI) – namely, it allows for effective (inverse) computation of various inputs\\nthat can yield a given output.\\nIf the DSL has both non-EE and non-EI operators, then neither bottom-up nor top-down strategies\\nare effective. Recently, it was observed that one could scale synthesis to larger DSLs by combining\\nthe two strategies [Lee 2021]. If there is a partition of the DSL such that the sub-DSL closer to\\nthe start symbol has EI operators, and the rest contains EE operators, then the two strategies\\ncan be combined to yield a meet-in-the-middle strategy at that cut [Lee 2021]. However, this new\\nstrategy still has only a limited form of information flow between the inputs and the output. In\\nfact, the DSLs used in Duet [Lee 2021] are relatively small, albeit larger than those in FlashFill and\\nFlashMeta [Gulwani 2011; Polozov and Gulwani 2015]. These latter systems are based on a TD\\nstrategy over very small DSLs.\\nAn alternate way to scale PBE synthesis is based on abstraction and refinement types [Feng et al.\\n2017; Guo et al. 2020; Polikarpova et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2017]. The idea behind abstraction is that\\ninstead of computing the exact set of values that can be generated (in either top-down or bottom-up\\nstrategy), we compute overapproximations of the sets of values. This approach works when high\\nquality abstractions can be quickly generated. Typically, it is still “one-sided” – either the inputs flow\\nto intermediate values or the output value flows backwards to intermediate values. Furthermore,\\nabstractions of compositions of operators are computed by composing the abstractions of operators,\\nwhich loses accuracy as the composition depth grows. We overcome some of these shortcomings\\nin our work; however, abstraction-based approaches are inherently complementary.1\\nOur Contribution. In this paper, we present two novel techniques - cuts and precedence - to\\neffectively address the scalability challenges of PBE synthesis. The executable semantics functions\\n(that are the basis of BU) and the witness functions (that are basis of TD) are defined to allow\\ninformation to flow in one direction. We introduce cuts that prune values generated by witness\\nfunctions guided by the values that sub-DSLs could possibly compute on the inputs. This concept\\ninherently builds in bi-directional information flow in its definition, and in fact, generalizes the\\nsemantics functions and witness functions. A DSL designer can author a cut function based on their\\nintuition of the form of values that can be computed at a nonterminal using the inputs, and then\\nrestricting them to those that would be relevant for the output. Unlike abstractions, cuts are not\\ncomputed compositionally. They are provided for whole sub-DSLs; thus, they avoid information loss\\naccumulated by composing lossy abstractions. This is similar to how accelerations avoid information\\nloss in program analysis by capturing the effect (composition or transitive closure) of multiple state\\ntransitions by a single “meta transition” [Finkel 1987; Karp and Miller 1969].\\nA top-down strategy would get stuck at a non-EI operator. However, a cut function for an\\nargument of that non-EI operator can help unblock TD synthesis. As a special case, a cut for that\\nargument can be generated using bottom-up enumeration, in which case we get the meet-in-the-\\nmiddle strategy [Lee 2021]. However, cuts may be generated by other means based on the DSL\\ndesigner’s insight. In general, we get a novel search strategy, middle-out synthesis, which uses cuts\\n1In this paper, we focus exclusively on synthesis approaches based on concrete values: the specification is a concrete IO\\nexample, and the semantics functions (and the inverse semantics) are given on concrete values (and not abstract values or\\nrefinement types). More specifically, we are in the context of version-space algebra (VSA) driven synthesis, and hence the\\nterms top-down and bottom-up are always used in that context.\\nProc. ACM Program.

Tiwari\\nto reduce the original PBE problem over a large DSL (with potentially non-EI and non-EE operators)\\ninto simpler PBE problems over (smaller depth) sub-DSLs with only EI or only EE operators.\\nOur second key idea is to introduce precedence over operators in the grammar of domain-specific\\nlanguages. Precedence is a natural concept in grammars and arises naturally when the DSL designer\\nwants to prefer certain operators over others. We show that if the precedence is a series-parallel\\npartial order, then it can be encoded as an ordering on grammar rules to create a guarded DSL (gDSL),\\nand program search can be performed directly on the gDSL without compromising soundness or\\ncompleteness, while gaining efficiency. The ordering on rules in a gDSL is interpreted as a mandate\\nto explore a certain branch only when higher-ordered branches have failed to return a result. This\\nhas two major advantages. First, it makes the search more scalable by dynamically using different\\nunderapproximations of the DSL to be explored. Second, it makes ranking simpler to write for DSL\\ndesigners because the precedence already builds in a default ranking over programs.\\nCuts and precedence provide DSL designers two new mechanisms to control the program search\\nspace, beyond what they get through designing DSLs. Our contributions include:\\n• A new algorithmic approach for PBE (middle-out synthesis) that leverages a novel cut rule to\\nspeed up synthesis over large DSLs and to handle non-EI and non-EE operators.\\n• A new formalism of guarded DSLs that supports operator precedence, and an extension of\\nour synthesis approach to gDSLs that scales synthesis to large DSLs and gives ranking based\\non path orderings [Dershowitz and Jouannaud 1990] for free.\\n• A new and expressive system FlashFill++ for string transformations that supports datetime &\\nnumber manipulations and is designed for readable code generation.\\n• An extensive comparison of FlashFill++ with existing state-of-the-art PBE systems for string\\ntransformations (FlashFill [Gulwani 2011], SmartFill [Chen et al. 2021a], and Duet [Lee 2021])\\nthat shows improvements in expressiveness, learning performance, and code readability.\\n2\\nOVERVIEW\\n2.1\\nNew Challenges in PBE for String Transformations\\nWe first discuss some challenges faced by the current generation of PBE tools for string trans-\\nformations. These challenges were compiled in collaboration with two key industrial deployers\\nof PBE: the Microsoft Excel and the Microsoft PowerBI teams. To compile these challenges, we\\ninterviewed several product managers in these teams, interacted with both expert and novice users\\nof the FlashFill feature, and analyzed online help posts.\\nGenerating Readable Code. Consider the task of transforming the input pair (\"David Walker\",\\n\"623179\") to the output string \"D-6231#walker\". Any string processing library would contain\\nmany redundant methods for extracting \"Walker\" from \"David Walker\". For example, in Python,\\nwe could use the split method to accomplish the task. Alternatively, we could use the find method\\nalong with string slicing, or use regular expressions.\\nIn contrast to the design of string processing libraries, the prevailing wisdom in DSL design for\\nsynthesis has been to work with a minimal number of operators [Gulwani 2016]. For example,\\nFlashFill [Gulwani 2011] and the more recent Duet [Lee 2021] DSLs contain only 3 and 5 functions\\nthat directly operate on strings, respectively. Smaller DSLs lead to smaller program search spaces,\\nyielding better synthesis performance and effective ranking [Polozov and Gulwani 2015]. Following\\nthis minimalism to an extreme can lead to a DSL whose programs translate to very unnatural and\\nunreadable programs in target languages like Python (see Figure 1) or PowerFx (see Figure 2).\\nOne straightforward approach to readability is writing a good translator from the synthesis DSL\\nto the target language. However, if the semantic gap between the DSL and the target languages’\\noperators is large, then “readable translation” itself becomes a new and nontrivial synthesis problem.\\nProc. ACM Program.

FlashFill++’s program is much more readable and its readability\\nis further improved by renaming variables using a pretrained large language model, as shown.\\nOur insight is that to effectively generate readable code the DSLs should not be designed with the\\nsingle-minded goal of efficient learning, but also pay heed to the target languages.\\nWhile generating readable code is challenging, the need is sorely felt in industrial PBE tools—\\nusers are more likely to trust and use PBE tools if they produce idiomatic, readable code. Quoting\\none study participant in [Drosos et al. 2020]: “don’t know what is going on there, so I don’t know if I\\ncan trust it if I want to extend it to other tasks. I saw my examples were correctly transformed, but\\nbecause the code is hard to read, I would not be able to trust what it is doing”. The lack of readable\\ncode is one of the primary challenges preventing a broader adoption of PBE technologies.\\nMultiple Target Languages. The need for readable code generation is compounded by the\\nproliferation of different target languages, each with their own set of operations; see Figure 3.\\nThese target languages range across standard programming languages (e.g., Python, R), individual\\nlibraries (e.g., Pandas, PySpark), data query languages (e.g., SQL), and custom application-specific\\nlanguages (e.g., Google Sheets & Excel formula languages, PowerBI’s M language). Apart from the\\nobvious benefit, multiple target support can also help with learning: seeing the same program in\\nmultiple languages helps with cross-language knowledge transfer [Shrestha et al. 2018].\\nDate-Time and Numeric Transformations. Most string PBE technologies cannot natively\\nhandle date-time and numeric operations efficiently, leading to situations like transforming ‘jan’\\nto ‘Janember’ given the input-output example ‘nov’ ↦→‘November’. Duet [Lee 2021] does allow\\nfor limited numeric operators, but still lacks support for important data-processing operations\\nsuch as rounding and bucketing. According to the Microsoft Excel team, date-time and numeric\\noperations (of the kind shown in Figure 3) are among the most requested FlashFill features.

Each call\\nlog, shown in the Input column, contains an (optional) address, the township, the call date and time,\\nfollowed by possible annotations indicating the specific 911 station that addressed the call. Let us\\nsuppose that a data scientist wants to extract the date (2015-12-11) and time (13:34:52) from each log,\\nand map it to the corresponding weekday (Fri) and the 3-hour window (12PM - 3PM), as shown in\\nthe Output column. Performing this transformation requires string processing to extract candidate\\ndates and times, parsing these substrings into appropriate datatypes, performing type-specific\\ntransformations on the extracted values, and then formatting them into an appropriate output\\nstring value. This is beyond the capabilities of current synthesizers. Our system can synthesize the\\nintended program (shown in Fig. 4(b)) from just the first example. This program is readable and\\nalso serves educational value (e.g. teaching the API of the popular datetime Python library).\\n2.2\\nOverview of FlashFill++\\nWe now show how our novel techniques address the various challenges from subsection 2.1.\\nExtended Domain-Specific Language. The main strength of FlashFill++ compared to previous\\nsystems is its expanded DSL containing over 40 operators, including 25 for just strings and the rest\\nfor datetime and numbers, such as for rounding and bucketing; see Figure 7. Contrast this with the\\nnumbers 3 and 5 mentioned previously for FlashFill and Duet.\\nThis extended DSL supports more expressive and more readable programs. Contrast the code\\ngenerated by FlashFill++ in Fig. 1 and 2 to that generated by FlashFill to see the clear difference an\\nextended DSL makes. However, expanding the DSL comes with its own set of challenges: (a) Given\\nthe larger search space, standard synthesis techniques fall short on efficiency. (b) The larger search\\nspace also complicates ranking—the problem of picking the best (or intended) program among all\\nthe ones consistent with the examples. (c) Handling numeric and date-time operators requires new\\nsynthesis techniques. Next, we discuss some novel strategies to address these challenges.\\nCuts and Middle-Out Synthesis. Our new DSL contains several non-EI operators (required for\\nnumber and datetime operations) that inhibit use of a top-down synthesis strategy across those\\noperators. Furthermore, bottom-up synthesis is not feasible for the sub-DSLs below those operators\\nProc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 7, No. POPL, Article 33. Publication date: January 2023.'),\n",

For example, if the top-level operator is concat(𝑁1, 𝑁2)\\nand the input-output example is 𝑖↦→“abc”, the witness function for the 1𝑠𝑡position will return\\n{“a”, “ab”} (assuming we do not consider the trivial case of appending an empty string). In the\\nexample we are considering, writing a witness functions for the RoundNumber operator is not as\\nstraight-forward—there are an infinite set of numbers that can round to 24.00. A standard top-down\\nprocedure cannot handle this infinite-width witness function.\\nBottom-Up Synthesis. The other major paradigm for programming-by-example is bottom-up syn-\\nthesis: here, the synthesizer starts enumerating programs – starting from constants and iteratively\\napplying operators from the grammar on the previously generated programs – and checks if any\\nof the enumerated programs satisfies the given input-output example. An efficient bottom-up\\nsynthesizer will avoid enumerating all programs using observational equivalence—that is, it only\\ngenerate programs that produce different outputs for the given input. In our running example, the\\nsynthesizer will begin by generating substr sub-programs and concrete values for locale and\\nroundNumberDesc. However, enumerating such sub-programs is expensive—the fragment of the\\nDSL reachable from the non-terminal substr is large. In fact, string operations like substr are\\nbest handled using witness functions.\\nMiddle-Out Synthesis using Cuts. Examining our input-output example by hand, it is easy to see that\\nin any valid program the output of ParseNumber should be derived from a numerical substring\\nin the input. Intuitively, it does not matter what or how complex the substr sub-program is; we\\ncan be confident that the output of the ParseNumber will be either 24.58 or 46. Cuts capture this\\nsimple intuition—for a given input-output example 𝑖↦→𝑜and a non-terminal 𝑁that expands to\\n𝑓(𝑁1, 𝑁2), the cut for 𝑁1 (say) in the context of 𝑁will be a set of values {𝑜1,𝑜2, . . . ,𝑜𝑛} such that\\nin any desired program 𝑃generated by 𝑁, the output of the sub-program corresponding to 𝑁1 will\\nbe one of the 𝑜𝑘for 𝑘∈{1, 2, . . . ,𝑛}.\\nGiven that the output of ParseNumber will be either 24.58 or 46, the synthesizer has two sub-\\ntasks for the 24.58 case (the 46 case will be similar): (a) synthesizing a program for 𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑠𝑒𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟\\nfor the example 𝑖↦→24.58, and (b) synthesizing a program for 𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑁𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟for the example\\n𝑖↦→24.00 using a modified DSL, which is generated dynamically in middle-out synthesis, where\\nProc.

Both sub-tasks can now be\\nrecursively solved, possibly using either the top-down strategy or the bottom-up strategy.\\nGuarded Context-Free Grammars. The larger program space resulting from an extended DSL\\nwith a wide range of operators poses both efficiency and ranking challenges. However, human\\nprogrammers often encounter the same challenge when writing their own implementations and\\ndecide between these operators and programs using simple rules of thumb, which can be leveraged\\nboth for improving search efficiency and ranking. For example, “if a task can be done using a date-\\ntime function, do not use string transformation functions” or “if a task can be done using string\\nindexing, do not use regular expressions”. To mimic this kind of coarse reasoning, we introduce\\nthe notion of gDSLs. In a gDSL, the production rules for each non-terminal are ordered (with a\\npartial order |⊲), with production rules earlier in the order preferred to ones later in the order. For\\nexample, the rule concat := segment |⊲Concat(segment, concat) expresses that we always\\nprefer programs that do not use the Concat operation to ones that do. During synthesis for a gDSL\\nrule 𝑁→𝛼|⊲𝛽the branch 𝛽is explored only if the branch 𝛼fails to produce a program. This\\ngreatly improves the performance of synthesis and the FlashFill++ synthesis times are competitive\\nwith other synthesis techniques that work with significantly smaller DSLs.\\nApart from improving the efficiency of search, gDSLs also simplify the task of writing ranking\\nfunctions. Intuitively, the precedence in the guarded rules induce a ranking on programs, and any\\nadditional ranking function only needs to order the remaining incomparable programs. Precedences\\nrank programs by a lexicographic path ordering (LPO) [Dershowitz and Jouannaud 1990], and our\\nfinal ranker will be a lexicographic combination of LPO and base arithmetic ranker – such program\\nrankers have not been used in program synthesis before.\\n3\\nBACKGROUND: PROGRAMMING BY EXAMPLE\\nWe now define the problem of programming-by-example and discuss common solutions.\\n3.1\\nDomain-Specific Languages\\nWe use domain-specific languages (DSLs) to specify the set of target programs for a synthesizer.\\nFormally, a DSL D is given by ⟨N, T, F, R, Vin, 𝑣out⟩where:\\n• N is a finite set of non-terminal symbols (or non-terminals). The symbol 𝑣out is a special start\\nnon-terminal in N that represents the output of a program in the DSL.\\n• T is a set of terminal symbols (or terminals) that is partitioned as Vin ∪O into inputs Vin and\\nvalues O. The set Vin contains special terminals, in1, in2, . . ., that represent the input symbols\\nin a program of the DSL. The set O contains constant values.\\n• F is a finite set of function symbols (or operations). Each operation f ∈F has a fixed arity\\nArity(f). The semantics of f, denoted by JfK, is a mapping from OArity(f) to O.\\n• R is a set of rules of the form 𝑁→f(𝑣1, . . . , 𝑣𝑘) or 𝑁→𝑣0 where 𝑁∈N, f ∈F , 𝑣0 ∈T,\\nand 𝑣1, . . . , 𝑣𝑘∈N ∪T.\\nThe formalism above is untyped for ease of reading.

An example Ex is a pair 𝑆↦→𝑜of a state 𝑆and value 𝑜.\\nA synthesis task ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩is given by: (a) a term 𝛼, which is either a nonterminal, terminal, or\\nright-hand side of a rule, (b) a set R of rules, and (c) an example 𝑆↦→𝑜. A solution of the synthesis\\ntask ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩is a program 𝑃such that: (a) J𝑃K(𝑆) = 𝑜, and (b) 𝑃∈L(𝛼). Here, J𝑃K : OVin ↦→O\\nrepresents the standard semantics of a program. Formally, J𝑃K(𝑆) is recursively defined as: (1)\\nJin𝑖K(𝑆) = 𝑆(in𝑖), (2) J𝑜K(𝑆) = 𝑜for every value 𝑜, (3) Jf(𝑣1, 𝑣2)K(𝑆) = JfK(J𝑣1K(𝑆), J𝑣2K(𝑆)) for every\\noperator f. To keep the presentation simple, the synthesis task is defined to contain one input-output\\nexample. In practice, a synthesis task often involves multiple examples. It is straight-forward to\\nextend our technique for this, as done in our implementation.\\nExample 3.2. A sample synthesis task for the affine expression DSL D𝐴is ⟨output, R,𝑆↦→7⟩\\nwhere 𝑆= {input1 ↦→2, input2 ↦→0}. The program Plus(Times(3, input1), 1) is a solution of\\nthis task. Here Times and Plus have their usual arithmetic semantics.\\n□\\nGiven a synthesis task ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩, a synthesizer generates a program set PS such that every\\nprogram in the set PS is a solution of the synthesis task, which we denote by the assertion PS |=\\n⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩. Note that it is vacuously true that ∅|= ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩, and so practical synthesizers\\nstrive to establish the above assertion for nonempty sets PS. The notation ̸|= ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩denotes\\nthat there is no nonempty set PS that is a solution for the synthesis task.\\n3.3\\nBottom-Up and Top-Down Synthesis\\nThere are two main approaches for solving the synthesis task: bottom-up and top-down.\\nThe bottom-up (BU) approach enumerates programs generated by different nonterminals of the\\ngrammar and collects the values that those programs compute on the input state 𝑆. More precisely,\\nfor each nonterminal 𝑁′, the BU approach computes the bottom-up value set bu𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜) given by\\n{J𝑃′K(𝑆) | 𝑃′ ∈L(𝑁′)}. These sets are computed starting from the leaf (terminals) of the grammar\\nand moving up to the root (start symbol 𝑣out). Success is declared if the output value 𝑜is found to\\nbe in the set bu𝑣out (𝑆↦→𝑜).

The top-down value sets are computed using witness functions. An\\noperator f with arity 𝑛is associated with 𝑛witness functions - one for each argument position. The\\n𝑘-th witness function, WFf,𝑘: O𝑘↦→2O, for operator f maps the desired output and 𝑘−1 values\\nfor previous arguments to possible values for the 𝑘-th argument.

For example, if the top-level operator is Plus and the output is 7, the\\npossible arguments for Plus would be (0, 7), (1, 6), (2, 5), . . ., and hence, WFPlus,1(7) = {0, 1, 2, . . .}\\nand WFPlus,2(7,𝑥) = {7 −𝑥}.\\nTop-down and bottom-up synthesis are both efficient and practical in different scenarios. TD\\nsynthesis performs well when operators are effectively invertible (EI), i.e., the witness functions\\nWFf,𝑘for each operator f produces sets that are finite and manageable in size. BU synthesis performs\\nwell when the grammar is effectively enumerable (EE), i.e., both the number of constants in the\\ngrammar is bounded and the number of different intermediate values produced is manageable.\\nNote that the focus in this paper is exclusively on synthesis approaches based on concrete values:\\nthe semantics and witness functions are given on concrete values, and not abstract values or types.\\nAbstractions and types can make top-down strategies work on grammars with non-EI operators,\\nfor example [Feng et al. 2017; Polikarpova et al. 2016], but require additional machinery, such as\\ntype systems, abstract domains, and constraint solvers.\\nExample 3.3. The affine expression DSL from Example 3.1 is neither effectively invertible nor\\neffectively enumerable. The operator Plus has a witness function WFPlus,1 which produces a set\\nof size 𝑛+ 1 for an example 𝑆↦→𝑛. Further, it contains an infinite number of constants (i.e., the\\nnon-negative integers) which make bottom-up approach infeasible. In the FlashFill++ DSL, many\\nstring operators are not effectively invertible. E.g., the LowerCase operator’s witness function that\\ncan produce a set that is exponential in the input’s length: WFLowerCase,1(‘abc’) produces a set of\\nsize 8, i.e., {‘ABC’, ‘ABc’, ‘AbC’, ‘aBC’, ‘abC’, ‘aBc’, ‘Abc’, ‘abc’}.\\n□\\nIn Section 4, we introduce cuts that can be used to decompose the synthesis problem to enable\\nmiddle-out synthesis, which can learn over deep DSLs – DSLs that can generate programs with\\nlarge depth – where neither bottom-up nor top-down is feasible. In Section 5, we introduce gDSLs,\\nwhich provide a precedence-based mechanism to help learning scale to broad DSLs – DSLs with\\nseveral options for a single nonterminal.\\n4\\nCUTS AND MIDDLE-OUT SYNTHESIS\\nTop-down and bottom-up approaches, as well as their combination, struggle to scale to large DSLs.\\nCuts can help scale synthesis. If we want to generate a value 𝑜at nonterminal 𝑁, and another\\nnonterminal 𝑁′ is on the path from 𝑁to the terminals, then a cut at 𝑁′ returns values to generate\\nat 𝑁′ that can help with generating 𝑜at 𝑁.\\nDefinition 4.1 (Cuts). Given a synthesis task ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩and a non-terminal 𝑁′ ∈N, a cut\\nCut𝑁′,𝑁for 𝑁′ in the context 𝑁, maps an example, 𝑆↦→𝑜, to a set of values.

Typically, we define cuts Cut𝑁′,𝑁when 𝑁→𝑓(𝑁′, 𝑁′′) is a\\ngrammar rule. Such a cut can be used in place of the witness function for the first argument of 𝑓.\\nLet us illustrate cuts through an example.\\nProc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 7, No. POPL, Article 33.

The cut inference rule that enables middle-out program synthesis.\\nExample 4.2. Consider again the synthesis task from Section 2.2, where the input-output example\\nwas 𝑆↦→24.00 and the input state 𝑆was ⟨in1 ↦→“The price is $24.58 and 46 units are\\navailable.” ⟩. Suppose we want to synthesize a program from this example starting from the\\nnonterminal roundNumber of the FlashFill++ DSL (Figure 7). One potential cut for parseNumber in\\nthe context roundNumber could work by scanning the input for any maximal substrings that are\\nnumerical constants and returning them (as a number). Here, it would return {24.58, 46}. A more\\nsophisticated cut could additionally look at the output 24.00 and only return the set {24.58}, as it is\\nthe only value in the string that can be rounded down to 24.00. These cuts are not complete as they\\ndo not include 24.5, which can also be extracted from the input and rounded to 24.\\n□\\nRecall that we model synthesizers as generating nonempty program sets PS and asserting\\nPS |= ⟨𝛼, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩. Figure 5 presents a new inference rule, called the cut rule, that can be used\\nto generate such assertions. This rule can be used in conjunction with any synthesizer (such\\nas those based on top-down or bottom-up approach). The cut rule uses a cut for a nonterminal\\n𝑁1 in the context of 𝑁to decompose the overall synthesis task ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩into two subtasks\\n⟨𝑁1, R,𝑆↦→𝑜1⟩and ⟨𝑁, R with 𝑁1 →𝑜1,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩. The first, or inner, subtask tries to find a program\\nin L(𝑁1) that maps 𝑆to 𝑜1, whereas the second, or outer, subtask tries to find a program in L(𝑁)\\nthat maps 𝑆to 𝑜assuming that we have a program to maps 𝑆to 𝑜1. The notation R with 𝑁1 →𝑜1\\nsimply means we remove all old rules in R of the form 𝑁1 →𝛼and only have one rule 𝑁1 →𝑜1.\\nThe cut rule also shows how the solutions to the two subtasks are combined to generate a solution\\nfor the original synthesis task.\\nTheorem 4.3. [Soundness] If program sets PS1 and PS2 are such that PS1 |= ⟨𝑁1, R,𝑆↦→𝑜1⟩and\\nPS2 |= ⟨𝑁, R with 𝑁1 →𝑜1,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩, then PS2[𝑜1 ↦→PS1] |= ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩. Furthermore, [complete-\\nness] if a program 𝑃is a solution for the synthesis task ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩and the program 𝑃contains a\\nsubprogram 𝑃1 ∈L(𝑁′) that maps the input 𝑆to a value 𝑜1 (i.e., J𝑃1K(𝑆) = 𝑜1), then 𝑜1 will be in the\\ncut Cut𝑁1,𝑁(𝑆↦→𝑜) assuming that the cut is complete, and moreover, the program 𝑃[𝑃1 ↦→𝑜1] is a\\nsolution for the task ⟨𝑁, R with 𝑁1 →𝑜1,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩.\\nWe use the term middle-out synthesis to describe the synthesis approach that uses the Rule MO.Cut\\nto perform synthesis. Note that the subproblems created by Rule MO.Cut can be solved using either\\nthe top-down approach, or the bottom-up approach, or the middle-out approach, or a hybrid\\ncombination of the approaches. One common strategy is: after applying Rule MO.Cut, we solve\\nthe outer subtask using bottom-up or hybrid approach, and for each 𝑜1 for which the outer has a\\nsolution, we solve the inner subtask using the top-down or hybrid approach. Note that the cut rule\\ncan be used multiple times to solve a synthesis task.\\nExample 4.4. Consider the synthesis task ⟨roundNumber, R,𝑆↦→24.00⟩from Example 4.2. Us-\\ning the fact that 24.58 was in the cut for parseNumber, we can use MO.Cut rule from Figure 5\\nand get the subtasks ⟨parseNumber, R,𝑆↦→24.58⟩and ⟨roundNumber, R′,𝑆↦→24.00⟩, where R′\\nis R with parseNumber →24.58. The second subproblem now has only one rule for parseNumber,\\nwhich directly generates 24.58. The first subproblem now has to generate 24.58 from the input, and\\nthe second subproblem has to round 24.58 to 24.00.\\n□\\nProc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 7, No. POPL, Article 33.

Cuts neatly\\ngeneralize both these approaches, allowing us the possibility to use a set of values influenced by\\nboth: (a) the set 𝐵of values reachable through forward semantics from the input values (bottom-up\\nsearch), and (b) the set 𝑇of values reachable through inverse semantics from the output values\\n(top-down search).\\nRecall that the set bu𝑁′ is the set of values that bottom-up enumeration generates corresponding\\nto nonterminal 𝑁′ and the set td𝑁,𝑁′ is the set of values that arise at 𝑁′ by repeatedly applying\\n(precise) witness functions starting from 𝑁. Let real value set rv𝑁,𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜) be the set of values\\nJ𝑃′K(𝑆) where 𝑃′ ∈L(𝑁′) is a sub-program of a program 𝑃∈L(𝑁) such that J𝑃K(𝑆) = 𝑜. Clearly,\\nit can be seen that rv𝑁,𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜) ⊆td𝑁,𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜) ∩bu𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜). Restating the definition of\\ncomplete cuts, a cut is complete if and only if the set it returns is a superset of rv𝑁,𝑁′(𝑆↦→𝑜). Both\\ntop-down and bottom-up search for synthesis are special cases of cut-based middle-out synthesis.\\nTheorem 4.5. [Cuts generalize top-down and bottom-up value sets.] Given a synthesis problem\\n⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩and a non-terminal 𝑁′, both the functions bu𝑁′ and td𝑁,𝑁′ are complete cuts for the\\nnon-terminal 𝑁′ in the context of 𝑁.\\nIn the light of this theorem, restricting the cut in the middle-out synthesis rule from Figure 5 to\\nonly being bu𝑁′ produces the state-of-the-art combination of top-down and bottom-up synthesis\\nDuet [Lee 2021]. While the above theorem states that TD and BU analyses produce complete cuts,\\nnot all complete cuts are (overapproximations of) top-down value set or bottom-up value set.\\nExample 4.6. Building on Example 4.2, consider now the example 𝑆↦→24.58, but we want\\nto synthesize a program from this example starting from the nonterminal parseNumber, which\\nhas a rule parseNumber →ParseNumber(substr, locale). One potential cut for substr in the\\ncontext parseNumber could be obtained by scanning the input string for any substrings that are\\nnumerical constants and returning them (as a string). Here it returns a set containing “24.58” and\\n“46” and all substrings of these two strings that are valid numbers. This complete cut is not an\\noverapproximation of the bottom-up values that substr can generate since there are many more\\nsubstrings in an input. However, it is complete in the context parseNumber because these are the\\nonly strings that can be parsed as numbers.\\n□\\n4.2\\nComputing Cuts\\nWe can use top-down value sets or bottom-up value sets as the cuts, as shown in Theorem 4.5;\\nhowever, if we do that, we only replicate top-down, bottom-up, and Duet’s meet-in-the-middle\\nsynthesis [Lee 2021]. DSL designers can provide more refined cuts that would enable going beyond\\ncurrent methods. How can designers author more refined cuts? For most operators, using witness\\nfunctions to perform top-down synthesis might suffice. Specialized cuts are only required when we\\nhave not-effectively-invertible operators that have either no witness function or very inefficient\\nwitness functions.\\nIn practice, DSL designers do not necessarily have to use complete cuts. Looking back at Exam-\\nple 4.6, the set {“24.58”, “46”} is a reasonable, but incomplete cut, because any program that extracts\\na number from a strict substring, say “4.5”, of these two strings would be a contrived program. Cuts\\nare reminiscent of interpolants or invariants from program analysis: a cut at 𝑁′ in the context of 𝑁\\nis the denotation of an invariant that holds true at 𝑁′ for all programs that compute the desired\\noutput at 𝑁. We next describe a few cut functions used in FlashFill++ along with the DSL designer’s\\nintuition about the DSL that helped construct that cut function.\\nProc. ACM Program.

Cambronero, S. Gulwani, V. Le, D. Perelman, A. Radhakrishna, C. Simon, A. Tiwari\\nCut for LowerCase. When computing a cut for a nonterminal 𝑁′ in context of nonterminal 𝑁, we\\nneed to consider all paths from 𝑁′ to 𝑁in the grammar. We focus on one path at a time, and take a\\nunion if there are multiple paths. Consider the grammar rule single := LowerCase(concat) in the\\nFlashFill++ DSL (Figure 7), and ignore the other paths between nonterminals single and concat\\nfor now. Clearly, the witness function is given as:\\nWFLowerCase,1(𝑦) = {𝑥| lowercase(𝑥) = 𝑦}\\nThe returned set contains 2len(𝑦) strings. In contrast, the cut could be much smaller. Ignoring other\\npaths between the two nonterminals, one possible cut is:\\nCutconcat,single(𝑆↦→𝑦) = {𝑥| lowercase(𝑥) = 𝑦and each char of 𝑥is in some input in 𝑆}.\\nHere the DSL designer uses their knowledge that the non-terminal concat can only generate strings\\nwhose characters are in some input. One exception to this invariance rule are strings that are\\ngenerated as “constant strings\", and hence this cut is not complete, but it may be a reasonable\\ncompromise between completeness and efficiency. An alternative cut could be:\\n{𝑥| lowercase(𝑥) = 𝑦and for each char 𝑥[𝑖] of 𝑥, 𝑥[𝑖] is in some input or 𝑥[𝑖] == 𝑦[𝑖]}.\\nFinally, the designer can further refine the cut to only include those strings that contain large\\nchunks of substrings of some input. Consider input ‘Amal Ahmed <AMAL@CCS.NEU.EDU>’ and\\noutput ‘amal’. The witness function would return 16 values, all variations of the string ‘amal’\\nwith each letter optionally capitalized. However, a cut would only return 2 values ‘Amal’ and\\n‘AMAL’, i.e., those variations that occur contiguously in the input. The same kind of reasoning\\ncan be used on all other paths from concat to single that go via the operators UpperCase and\\nProperCase, and thus we can get a cut for concat in the context of single.\\nCut for Concat. Consider the grammar rule concat := segment|Concat(segment, concat) in the\\nFlashFill++ DSL (Figure 7). The witness function for (the first argument of) Concat is given by\\nWFConcat,1(𝑦) = {𝑥| 𝑥is a prefix of 𝑦}\\nThe DSL designer knows the invariant that every string generated by segment is either a substring\\nof an input, or a string representation of date or number, or a constant string. So, a possible cut,\\nCutsegment,concat(𝑆↦→𝑦), could be:\\n{𝑥| 𝑥is maximal prefix of 𝑦either contained in some input or a number or a date}.\\nThis cut is not complete since segment could generate a constant string, but the DSL designer may\\nprefer to use this cut and fallback on the witness function only if the above choices fail to work.\\nCut for RoundNumber and FormatDateTime. Example 4.2 presented the cut for parseNumber\\nin the context roundNumber. The witness function for roundNumber on the input 𝑆↦→24.00 will\\nhave to return an infinite set of floating point values that can all round to 24.00. However, the DSL\\ndesigner knows that parseNumber can only generate a number that occurs in the input, i.e., 24.58 or\\n46, and furthermore, numbers such as 4.5 are not reasonable choices. Hence, the designer can pick the\\ncut CutparseNumber,roundNumber(𝑆↦→𝑦):\\n{𝑥| 𝑥is a maximally long number extracted from a substring of an input}.\\nHere the DSL designer used their knowledge about the form of values that a nonterminal can\\ngenerate to construct a cut. Another such example is the cut, CutasDate,formatDate(𝑆↦→𝑦), which\\ncan be computed as:\\n{𝑥| 𝑥is a maximally long datetime value extracted from a substring of an input}.\\nProc. ACM Program.

We then introduce\\ngDSLs, which extend the notion of DSL (Section 3.1) with precedence. We then present the gDSL\\nfor FlashFill++ and inference rules that solve the PBE synthesis problem over gDSLs.\\n5.1\\nSynthesis with Preference\\nDSL designers who want to translate programs generated in a DSL into a popular target language,\\nsuch as Python, typically want the DSL to contain all operators from the target language libraries.\\nThese operators are often redundant. For example, substrings of a string can be extracted using\\nabsolute index positions, or regular expressions, or finding locations of constant substrings in the\\nstring, or splitting a string by certain delimiters. In such cases, whenever a task is achievable in\\nmany different ways, we get a so-called broad DSL. For broad DSLs, DSL designers often have a\\npreference for which operators to use. For example, they may prefer split over find, which they\\nmay prefer in turn over using regular expressions or absolute indices. As another example, DSL\\ndesigners may prefer transforming a string containing “Jan” to “January” by treating the substring\\naround “Jan” in the input as a datetime object and working with them, rather than generating\\n“January” by concatenating “Jan” with a constant string “uary”.\\nExample 5.1. Consider the task of extracting the second column from a line in a comma-separated\\nvalues (CSV) file, specified by the input-output example ‘WA, Olympia, UTC-8’ ↦→‘Olympia’.\\nIn the FlashFill++ DSL, this can be done using the program Split(x, ‘,’, 2), where 𝑥is the input,\\nor using the program Slice(x, Find(x, ‘,’, 1, 0), Find(x, ‘,’, 2, 0)). A traditional VSA-based syn-\\nthesizer would (possibly implicitly) produce both programs, assign scores to both using a ranking\\nfunction, and return the better ranked one. However, typically we strictly prefer programs that use\\nthe Split operator over the Slice operator. Ideally, a synthesizer should not even examine Slice\\nprograms when an equivalent Split program exists. Similar preference is also seen in Python\\nprogrammers who often prefer to use str.split over regex.find or str.find.\\n□\\nThis motivates the need to perform synthesis over a broad DSL where there is preference over\\noperators.

Tiwari\\nonly provides precedence over operators that occur as alternates for the same nonterminal; that is,\\nif the designer sets f1 ≻Σ f2, then 𝑁→f1(. . .) ∈R and 𝑁→f2(. . .) ∈R are two rules with the\\nsame nonterminal 𝑁in the grammar. We also assume that (A2) the relation ≻Σ is a strict partial\\norder (irreflexive, asymmetric, transitive) to ensure that the DSL designers preference is consistent.\\nWe first need to formalize what it means for a synthesizer to satisfy the operator precedence ≻Σ\\nprovided by the DSL designer. For this, we need to lift ≻Σ to a precedence on the set of programs 𝑃\\ngenerated by the DSL. However, this is not easy since it is not clear which of f1(f2(in)) or f′\\n1(f′\\n2(in))\\nto prefer if the DSL designer says f1 ≻Σ f′\\n1 and f′\\n2 ≻Σ f2. We resolve this issue by saying that the\\npreference for the operator occurring “above” in the program is more important than anything\\nbelow. In the above example, we give more weight to f1 ≻Σ f′\\n1 and hence we want f1(f2(in)) to be\\npreferred over f′\\n1(f′\\n2(in)). This follows the intuition that operators at the top in, say, the FlashFill++\\nDSL, such as Concat, FormatNumber, or FormatDateTime, are more influential in determining the\\nhigh-level strategy for solving a task than operators at the bottom, such as Split or Slice. Hence,\\nwe extend the user provided ≻Σ to ≻𝑒\\nΣ⊇≻Σ so that whenever 𝑁0 →f1(. . . , 𝑁1, . . .) and 𝑁1 →f2(. . .)\\nare rules in the DSL, then f1 ≻𝑒\\nΣ f2.\\nExample 5.2. Consider the synthesis task from Example 4.2 of generating ‘24.00’ from the input\\nstring. One possible program is Concat(𝑝1, ‘.00’), where 𝑝1 is a subprogram that extracts ‘24’\\nfrom the input string. A second possible program is Segment(FormatNumber(𝑝2, fmt_desc) that\\ngenerates ‘24.00’ by formatting a number computed by program 𝑝2. Here, Segment is a dummy\\nidentity operator having higher preference than Concat in the FlashFill++ gDSL (Figure 7). In the\\nFlashFill++ DSL, the second program is preferred since it does not use concatenation, irrespective of\\nhow 𝑝1 and 𝑝2 work—at the top-level concatenation is strictly less preferred. Note that here 𝑝1 is\\nlikely to be significantly smaller and simpler than 𝑝2 as it is just extracting the string ‘24’, while\\n𝑝2 is extracting a number and then rounding it. A traditional arithmetic ranking function (as used\\nin FlashFill and FlashMeta) intuitively computes the score of programs as a weighted sum of the\\nscore of its sub-programs, and hence, will need to be tuned carefully to ensure that the smaller\\nconcat program is scored worse than the larger segment program.\\n□\\nWe want the relation ≻𝑒\\nΣ to be a strict partial order. However, in general, it may not be a strict\\npartial order due to cycles in the grammar (where some 𝑁0 generates a term containing 𝑁0), which\\nagain makes ≻𝑒\\nΣ violate irreflexivity or transitivity. We make the reasonable assumption that there\\nare no cycles since we often limit the depth of terms being synthesized and then the assumption\\ncan be satisfied by renaming the nonterminals. Thus, without loss of much generality, we can\\nassume that the extended precedence ≻𝑒\\nΣ on Σ is a strict partial order.\\nNow we formalize synthesizing in presence of precedence ≻Σ by lifting the precedence ≻Σ on\\nΣ to ≻𝑒\\nΣ, and then to a preference on programs (trees) over Σ using the well-known lexicographic\\npath ordering (LPO), ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜, which is defined as follows [Dershowitz and Jouannaud 1990]: Given\\nprograms 𝑃1 := f1(𝑃11, . . . , 𝑃1𝑘) and 𝑃2 := f2(𝑃21, . . . , 𝑃2𝑙), we have 𝑃1 ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜𝑃2 if either (a) f1 ≻𝑒\\nΣ f2\\nand 𝑃1 ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜𝑃2𝑖for all 𝑖, or (b) f1 = f2 and there exists a 𝑚s.t.

A non-terminal 𝑁can have\\nany number of guarded rules associated with it, each with possibly different values of 𝑘≥1.\\nThe rules in a regular DSL can be viewed as a special case of guarded rules where 𝑘= 1 (in the\\ndefinition of guarded production rules above.) When 𝑘> 1, a guarded rule 𝑁→𝛼1 |⊲· · · |⊲𝛼𝑘\\nassociated with the nonterminal 𝑁has 𝑘alternates on the right-hand side that are ordered. The 𝑖-th\\nalternate 𝛼𝑖yields a (regular) rule 𝑁→𝛼𝑖. We call 𝑁→𝛼𝑖the 𝑖-th constituent rule of the original\\nguarded rule. Define R𝑐as the collection of all constituent rules of rules in R; that is, R𝑐:= {𝑁→\\n𝛼𝑖| 𝑁→(. . . |⊲𝛼𝑖|⊲. . .) ∈R}. We call the (regular) DSL D𝑐:= ⟨N, T, F, R𝑐, Vin, 𝑣out⟩obtained\\nfrom a gDSL D := ⟨N, T, F, R, Vin, 𝑣out⟩a constituent DSL of the gDSL D.\\nGiven an instance of the PBE synthesis with precedence problem, we can annotate the given DSL\\nwith precedence to get a gDSL. We assume that the precedence relation ≻Σ satisfies Assumptions (A1)\\nand (A2). Furthermore, we also assume that (A3) the precedence is a series-parallel partial order\\n(SPPO) [Béchet et al. 1997]. Under Assumption (A3), the precedence can be encoded in gDSL\\nby introducing new nonterminals where necessary. Specifically, if we have a maximal chain\\nf1 ≻Σ f2 ≻Σ . . . ≻Σ f𝑘over alternate operators 𝑁→f1(. . .)| · · · |f𝑘(. . .) in the DSL, then we\\nadd a guarded rule 𝑁→f1(. . .) |⊲· · · |⊲f𝑘(. . .). However, if certain alternate operators are left\\nincomparable by the DSL designers, then we introduce a new nonterminal. For example, if f1 ≻Σ f3\\nand f2 ≻Σ f3, but there is no preference between f1 and f2, then we introduce a new nonterminal\\n𝑁′ and have 𝑁→𝑁′ |⊲f3(. . .) and 𝑁′ →f1(. . .)|f2(. . .) in the gDSL. Any SPPO ≻Σ can thus be\\nencoded in the gDSL.\\nExample 5.4. Consider the DSL for affine arithmetic from Example 3.1. Suppose the DSL designer\\nwants the precedence input1 ≻Σ input2. Then, we can replace the two rules for nonterminal\\naddend by a single guarded rule: addend →Times(const, input1) |⊲Times(const, input2) to\\nget a gDSL, D𝑔\\n𝐴. In the LPO induced by the extension ≻𝑒\\nΣ of this preference, the program 𝑃1 :=\\nPlus(Times(3, input1), 1) is preferred over 𝑃2 := Plus(Times(3, input2), 7).\\n□\\nLet ⟨𝑣out, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩be a synthesis task, where R is the rules of a gDSL D. We say a program 𝑃is\\na solution for this task if\\n(a) 𝑃is a solution for the task ⟨𝑣out, R𝑐,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩(in the constituent DSL D𝑐), and\\n(b) for any other 𝑃′ that is a solution in the constituent DSL, 𝑃′ ⊁𝑙𝑝𝑜𝑃, where ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜is the LPO\\ninduced by the extended precedence ≻𝑒\\nΣ coming from the guarded rules.\\nCondition (a) says that 𝑃should be a solution for the synthesis problem ignoring the precedence.\\nCondition (b) says that the ordering in the rules should be interpreted as an ordering on programs\\nusing the induced LPO, and we should ignore programs smaller in this ordering.\\nExample 5.5. Consider the gDSL D𝑔\\n𝐴and programs 𝑃1, 𝑃2 from Example 5.4. Consider the synthesis\\ntask ⟨𝑣out, R, ⟨input1 ↦→2, input2 ↦→0⟩↦→7⟩from Example 3.2, but with R now coming from the\\ngDSL D𝑔\\n𝐴. Both programs, 𝑃1 and 𝑃2, map the input state to 7. However, 𝑃2 is now not a solution in\\nD𝑔\\n𝐴because there exists 𝑃1 that is preferred. The program 𝑃3 := 7 also maps the input state to 7.\\nThe (derivations of) 𝑃1 and 𝑃3 are incomparable; and in fact, both are solutions in D𝑔\\n𝐴.\\n□\\nIf a solution for the unguarded DSL exists, then there will be a solution that is maximal and\\nhence a solution for the gDSL will exist.\\nProc.

If 𝑁→𝛼1 |⊲𝛼2 is a guarded rule in R and we can (recursively)\\nprove 𝑃𝑆1 |= ⟨𝛼1, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩, then Rule Guarded.If can be used to assert 𝑃𝑆1 |= ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩. (This\\nassertion will be nontrivial only if 𝑃𝑆1 ≠∅.) In case there is no program that solves ⟨𝛼1, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩,\\nand we can (recursively) prove 𝑃𝑆2 |= ⟨𝛼2, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩, then Rule Guarded.Else can be used to assert\\n𝑃𝑆2 |= ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩.\\nRecall that the notation 𝑃𝑆|= ⟨𝑁, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩simply asserts that every program in 𝑃𝑆solves the\\ngiven synthesis task, and does not require 𝑃𝑆to contain all solutions. The Rule Guarded.Else has a\\ncondition that a certain synthesis task be unsolvable. If we have the ability to compute all solutions\\n(such as, using version-space algebras, or VSAs), then that can help in determining when a problem\\nis unsolvable, but other synthesis approaches that can establish infeasibility can also be used.\\nExample 5.7. Continuing from Example 5.5, consider the task of generating 7 from inputs 2\\nand 0. Say we reduce the original task to the proof obligation 𝑋|= ⟨addend, R,𝑆↦→𝑥⟩, where\\nwe pick say 6 for 𝑥. Now, we have a guarded rule for addend and we can use Rule Guarded.If\\nto get the proof obligation 𝑋|= ⟨Times(const, input1), R,𝑆↦→6⟩. This subtask has a solution\\n𝑋= {Times(3, input1)}, and hence we will not consider the option Times(const, input2).\\n□\\nPerforming synthesis over the gDSL is equivalent to solving PBE synthesis with precedence.\\nTheorem 5.8. Let ≻Σ be a precedence on Σ := F ∪T that satisfies Assumptions (A1), (A2), and (A3).\\nLet D := ⟨N, T, F, R, Vin, 𝑣out⟩be a gDSL that encodes ≻Σ. Let D𝑐:= ⟨N, T, F, R𝑐, Vin, 𝑣out⟩be\\nits (unguarded) constituent DSL. Let ⪰base be an ordering on programs and let ⟨𝑣out, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩be a\\nsynthesis task. Then, the following are equivalent:\\n(1) {𝑃} |= ⟨𝑣out, R,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩and 𝑃is maximal w.r.t ⪰base among all such solutions.\\n(2) The program 𝑃is a solution in D𝑐for the task ⟨𝑣out, R𝑐,𝑆↦→𝑜⟩that is maximal w.r.t a lexicographic\\ncombination of ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜(induced by ≻Σ) and ⪰base.\\nTheorem 5.8 shows that using a ranker ⪰base with a gDSL D has the same effect as using a\\ncomplex ranker (lexicographic combination of ≻𝑙𝑝𝑜and ⪰base) with a regular DSL D𝑐. This shows\\nthat our gDSL-based approach solves the PBE synthesis with precedence problem (under some\\nassumptions). Theorem 5.8 also explains why the ranker ⪰base used with a gDSL D can be very\\nsimple compared to what is needed with a regular DSL D𝑐. Designing a good complex ranking\\nfunction has traditionally been very challenging in PBE, taking many developer-months to converge\\non a good ranking function [Kalyan et al. 2018; Natarajan et al. 2019; Singh and Gulwani 2015]. In\\ncontrast, FlashFill++ uses the power of gDSLs (Theorem 5.8) to reduce the requirements on its base\\nranker, which was developed significantly faster.\\nProc. ACM Program.

Figure 7 shows a major part of the\\nDSL. FlashFill++ shares the top level rules that perform conditional statements, case conversion, and\\nstring concatenation with FlashFill. Conditionals enable if-then-else logic. The condition is one or\\nmore conjunctive predicates based on properties of the input string. Case conversion transforms a\\nstring into lower-, upper-, or proper-case. Concatenation concatenates two strings.\\nAlthough FlashFill can perform some datetime and number operations using text manipulation\\n(such as \"01/01/2020\" →\"2020\" or \"10.01\" →\"10\"), it is unable to express other sophisticated\\ndatetime and number operations as it does not incorporate operations over those datatypes, but\\nrather treats them as standard strings. For instance, FlashFill cannot get the day of week from a date\\n(such as \"01/01/2020\" →\"Wednesday\"), or round up a number (e.g., \"10.49\" →\"10.5\"). This\\nmotivates us to add new rules to support richer datetime (rules parseDate and formatDate) and\\nnumber (rules parseNumber and formatNumber) transformations.\\nThe next major differences are in the substr and pos rules.

While this is\\nexpressive enough to cover any desired substring selection and all of the operators in FlashFill++\\ncan technically be expressed in terms of it, this introduces a challenge for an industrial synthesizer\\nthat targets different languages for code generation: not all platforms of interest support regular\\nexpressions natively (e.g. Microsoft Excel’s formula language does not support regular expressions).\\nIn contrast, when designing FlashFill++ we chose a wider collection of more natural operators that\\nare closer to what developers use in practice when working with target languages – this removes\\nthe mismatch between synthesis DSL and code generation target language.\\nIn particular, instead of only allowing substrings to be defined as a Slice with their start and\\nend positions, FlashFill++ adds a Split operator to select the 𝑘th element in a sequence generated\\nby splitting the input string by some delimiters. We also add a MatchFull operator to find the 𝑘th\\nmatch of a regular expression. Additionally, in FlashFill++ the pos rule replaces the operator RegPos\\n(which relies on a pair of regular expressions to identify a position) with a Find of a constant string\\nin the input and a Match/MatchEnd of a regular expression.\\nExample Guarded Rules in the FlashFill++ DSL. We go over a few cases of guarded rules in FlashFill++\\nto show they capture natural intuitions and rules of thumb in the string transformation domain.\\n• Single segments over concats. The guarded rule segment |⊲Concat(segment, concat) ensures\\nthat we try to synthesize programs that generate the whole output at once, before generating\\nprograms that produce a prefix and a suffix of the output and then combine them. Whenever\\nsuch a program exists, this guarded rule potentially saves the exploration of a huge portion\\nof the program space. This single guarded rule plays a crucial role in keeping FlashFill++\\nperformant since witness function of the concat operator produces 2(𝑛−1) subtasks, one\\neach for the prefix and suffix at each point where the output string can be split.\\n• Splits over slices. As illustrated Example 5.1, FlashFill++ strictly prefers programs that use\\nthe Split operator over programs that use the Slice operator. Program in data wrangling\\nscenarios very commonly begin by extracting the appropriate part of the input from a\\ndelimited file record (CSVs, TSVs, etc). In all such cases, a split program more closely follows\\nthe human intuition of “extract the 𝑛𝑡ℎcolumn delimited by” as compared to a slice program.\\nNote that the split operator is a “higher level” construct preferred over the “low-level” slice.\\n• Input numbers over rounded numbers. The RoundNumber operator in Figure 7 is guarded by\\nparseNumber, meaning that we can only generate a program that rounds a number if no\\nnumber in the input can be used directly to produce the same output.\\n6\\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\\nWe now present our experimental results, including an ablation study and survey-based user study.\\n6.1\\nMethodology\\nWe used 3 publicly available benchmark sets – Duet string benchmarks [Lee 2021], Playgol [Cropper\\n2019], and Prose [PROSE 2022] – covering a range of string transformations, including datetime\\nand number formatting.\\nWe compare FlashFill++ with three systems: two publicly available state-of-the-art synthesis\\nsystems that are deployed in productions, namely FlashFill [Gulwani 2011] and SmartFill [Chen\\net al. 2021a; Google 2021], and one, Duet, from a recent publication [Lee 2021].

The tasks removed were unsuitable for browser automation (e.g. too many\\nrows or new line characters).\\nThe Duet tool [Lee 2021] accepts a DSL as part of its input. Different Duet benchmarks used\\nslightly different DSLs. For fair comparison, we set a single fixed DSL. We obtained the fixed DSL\\nby taking all commonly-used rules in the string transformation benchmarks of Duet. Second, Duet\\nhas some hyperparameters, for which we picked the best setting after some experimentation.\\n6.2\\nExpressiveness and Performance\\nA key feature of FlashFill++ is improved expressiveness. Table 1 (Columns 2–5) shows the number\\nof benchmark tasks that the various tools (rows) can correctly solve. FlashFill++ produces a correct\\nprogram for most number of benchmarks. FlashFill is limited due to a lack of datetime and number\\nformatting. The DSL used in the Duet tool has no datetime support, and only limited support for\\nnumber and string formatting. The SmartFill tool is a neural-based general purpose tool and has\\nthe weakest numbers here. Since our SmartFill experiments rely on browser-based interaction, it is\\npossible that the underlying synthesizer can solve more benchmarks but these are not exposed to\\nthe UI. However, our setup reflects the experience that a user would face.\\nOur DSL is expressive, covering a large class of string, datetime and number transformations;\\nthus showing the added value from using cuts and guarded rules.\\nWhile increasing expressiveness enables users to accomplish more tasks, there is a risk of reducing\\nperformance on existing tasks. To this end, we consider the minimum number of examples required\\nfor a synthesizer to learn a correct program. To find that number, we use a counter-example guided\\n(CEGIS) loop which provides the next failing I/O example in every iteration to the synthesizer.\\nWe use a time out of 20 seconds. Table 1 Columns 6–8 present the average number of examples\\nthe various tools used across the benchmarks where they were successful. Here FlashFill has the\\nbest numbers, which indicates that when it works (for string benchmarks), it learns with very\\nfew examples. Our tool FlashFill++ takes only slightly more examples on average, partly because\\ndatetime and number formatting typically requires more examples for intent disambiguation. For\\nexample, the string ‘2/3/2020’ can either be the 2𝑛𝑑of March or the 3𝑛𝑑of February. The Duet and\\nSmartFill tools take more examples in general. We emphasize that the performance of FlashFill++ is\\ngood here because it solves more problems (presumably much harder instances) and yet it doesn’t\\nuse too many more examples (the harder instances did not make the averages much worse).\\nProc.

On average, FlashFill++’s Python is 76% shorter and uses 83% fewer functions, whereas\\nFlashFill++’s PowerFx is 57% shorter and uses 55% fewer functions. We next compared the Google\\nSheets formula language code generated by SmartFill with Excel code generated by FlashFill++. We\\nfound that FlashFill++ does better in ≈60% of the formulas generated and is at parity for ≈20% of\\nthe formulas. We did not compare with Duet since it generates programs only in its DSL and not in\\nany target language.\\nNext, we carried out a survey-based user study where we asked users to read and compare\\ndifferent Python functions synthesized by alternative approaches. In our study, we further augment\\nFlashFill++ with a procedure to rename variables. This part of the system is optional, and is only\\nadded to further underscore the benefits of readable code generation. To perform variable renaming\\nwe use the few-shot learning capability of Codex [Chen et al. 2021b], a pretrained large language\\nmodel, and iteratively provide the following prompt [Gao et al. 2021]: (1) two samples of the\\nrenaming task, where each sample contains I/O examples, FlashFill++ program, and the renamed\\nprogram, (2) the current renaming task, which contains the examples and the FlashFill++ program\\nto be renamed, and (3) partially renamed program up to the next non-renamed variable.\\nWe sampled 10 tasks from our benchmarks, with probability proportional to the number of\\nidentifier renaming calls made to Codex. For each task, we displayed the Python code generated by\\nFlashFill, FlashFill++, and FlashFill++ with Codex (anonymized as A, B, and C). For the first 5 tasks,\\nthe participants were asked (on a 7-point Likert scale) the extent to which they agreed with the\\nstatements “FlashFill++ is more readable than FlashFill” and “FlashFill++ with Codex is more readable\\nthan FlashFill++”. For the last 5 tasks, the participants answered (on a 7-point Likert scale) the extent\\nto which they agreed with the statement “X is similar to the code I write”, where X was replaced\\nwith the corresponding (anonymized) system name.\\nFigure 10a shows that participants found code generated by FlashFill++ (without identifier renam-\\ning) was more readable than code generated by FlashFill for the same task. Adding Codex-based\\nrenaming further improved readability with most participants at least somewhat agreeing.\\nFigure 10b shows that participants strongly disagreed that FlashFill code is similar to the code\\nthey write. In contrast, most participants at least somewhat agreed that FlashFill++ code is similar\\nto the code they write. Adding identifier renaming resulted in improvements, across all five tasks.\\nWe also provided an open-ended text box for additional feedback with each task.

Accel-\\nerations are used to capture the effect (transitive closure) of multiple state transitions by a single\\n“meta transition” [Finkel 1987; Karp and Miller 1969]. It has often been used to handle numerical\\nupdates in programs, especially when more classical abstract interpretation techniques either do\\nnot converge or become very imprecise [Bardin et al. 2008; Boigelot 2003; Jeannet et al. 2014].\\nOur use of cuts inherits its motivation and purpose from these works, but applies them to PBE.\\nWhereas in program analysis, accelerations had success mostly on numerical domains, in PBE we\\nfind cuts helpful more generally. Currently, we assume cuts are provided by the DSL designer, but\\nautomatically generating them remains an interesting topic for future research.\\nIn PBE, cuts help speed-up search (by guiding top-down propagation across non-EI operators\\nbased on abstracting behavior of inner sub-DSLs). Other ways to speed-up search include using\\ntypes and other forms of abstractions [Guo et al. 2020; Osera and Zdancewic 2015; Wang et al.\\n2018], or combining search strategies [Lee 2021]. The difference between cuts and abstraction-based\\nmethods in synthesis is the same as the difference between accelerations and abstraction in program\\nanalysis. We need cuts for only some operators, whereas abstract transformers are required for\\nall operators. Moreover, the methods are not incompatible – a promising direction would be to\\ncombine them.\\nMiddle-out synthesis, enabled by cuts, is a new way to combine bottom-up [Alur et al. 2013,\\n2017] and top-down [Gulwani 2011; Polozov and Gulwani 2015] synthesis. It is very different from\\nthe meet-in-the-middle way of combining them where search starts simultaneously from the bottom\\n(enumerating subprograms that generate new values) and from the top (back propagating the\\noutput) until we find values that connect the two [Gulwani et al. 2011; Lee 2021]. Helped by the\\njump provided by cuts, middle-out synthesis starts at the middle creating two subproblems that can\\nbe solved using either approach. Meet-in-the-middle approach in [Lee 2021] guides the top-down\\nsearch based on the values propagated by bottom-up, similar to middle-out synthesis; however, our\\nProc. ACM Program.

The coopera-\\ntive synthesis framework in [Huang et al. 2020] proposes 3 such strategies that are used when the\\noriginal synthesis problem remains unsolved. However, [Huang et al. 2020] works on complete\\nlogical specifications, and not on input-output examples.\\nAt a very abstract level, top-down synthesis and middle-out synthesis can both be viewed as\\nan approach that synthesizes a sketch and then fills the sketch in a PBE setting [Feng et al. 2017;\\nPolikarpova et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2017, 2020]. In this context, Scythe [Wang et al. 2017] uses\\noverapproximation of the set of values that are computed by partial programs to synthesize a sketch.\\nUnlike our work, [Wang et al. 2017] is exclusively focused on bottom-up synthesis. Since [Wang\\net al. 2017] is bottom-up, its approximations get coarser as the program gets deeper. Scythe, tends\\nto do well for shallow programs. FlashFill++’s use of cuts is more “on-demand” and thus not affected\\nby depth of programs. In fact, FlashFill++ can synthesize deep programs, with the largest solution in\\nour benchmark suite having a depth of 24, with over 10% of our benchmarks requiring programs\\nwith a depth of at least 10. Furthermore, [Wang et al. 2017] is exclusively focused on SQL – its\\nmain contribution is an approach to overapproximate SQL queries that abstracts carefully selected\\nnonterminals. In contrast, our formalization is not fixed to any particular DSL, but relies on the\\nDSL designer to provide the cuts.\\nMorpheus [Feng et al. 2017] and Synquid [Polikarpova et al. 2016] overapproximate each com-\\nponent to prune partial programs to synthesize sketches that are subsequently filled. Morpheus\\nis specialized to tables and uses the distinction between value and table transformations. In con-\\ntrast, our framework is more general as it allows the use of approximations (cuts) for only certain\\nfunctions (wherever they are provided); however, we cannot (and do not) prune partial programs.\\nWe always work on concrete values – there is no abstract domain involved. We do not use SMT\\nsolvers, whereas SMT solvers are a key component of [Feng et al. 2017; Polikarpova et al. 2016].\\nPrecedence and gDSLs. Precedences or priorities have been used in many grammar formalisms,\\nbut mainly for achieving disambiguation while parsing in ambiguous grammars [Aasa 1995; Aho\\net al. 1973; Earley 1974; Heering et al. 1989]. Disambiguation here refers to preferring the parse\\n𝑎+(𝑏∗𝑐) over (𝑎+𝑏)∗𝑐for the same string 𝑎+𝑏∗𝑐. In contrast, we use gDSLs to compare derivations\\nof different strings (programs). Furthermore, in the work on filters and SDF [Heering et al. 1989],\\nthe semantics of the precedence relation ≻on rules is different: there 𝑆1 →𝑤1 ≻𝑆2 →𝑤2 means\\nthat one can not use 𝑆2 →𝑤2 as a child of 𝑆1 →𝑤1 in a parse tree [van den Brand et al. 2002]. In\\nour case, we disallow precedence on rules with different left-hand nonterminals. Nevertheless, our\\nprecedence can be viewed as a specialized filter in the terminology of [van den Brand et al. 2002].\\nFarzan and Nicolet [Farzan and Nicolet 2021] use a sub-grammar to optimize search. This can be\\nmodeled using our precedence operator. They use constraint-based synthesis (using SMT solvers)\\nwhere the interest is in any one correct program. Ranking is not of interest there, whereas we use\\nprecedence in the context of top-down synthesis where we synthesize program sets and rank them.\\nThe interaction of precedence in the grammar and the program ranking is one of our contributions.\\nCasper [Ahmad and Cheung 2018] uses a hierarchy of grammars growing in size for synthesis,\\nmaking search efficient. This hierarchy is dynamically generated - guided by the input-output\\nexample. Our precedence-based approach provides a different mechanism to constrain search. The\\nvalue of our approach is that it is easily integrated with the underlying synthesis framework, giving\\nsynthesis-engine-builders more flexibility in controlling search and ranking. Precedence is also\\nintuitive for DSL designers because they must think only locally to decide if the operators need a\\nprecedence relation. Technically speaking, our notion of precedence implicitly represents a lattice\\nof grammars rather than a strict linear hierarchy.\\nProc. ACM Program. Lang., Vol. 7, No. POPL, Article 33.

Cambronero, S. Gulwani, V. Le, D. Perelman, A. Radhakrishna, C. Simon, A. Tiwari\\nEarlier work on “Parsing expression grammars” [Ford 2004] introduces grammars that are like\\nCFGs, but contain features such as prioritized choice (precedence), greedy repetitions, etc., but\\nit does so for parsing, whereas our focus is on top-down, bottom-up, and combination synthesis\\ntechniques. Our novelty is in supporting precedence in our synthesis framework, and formally\\nworking out how it impacts ranking and search.\\nUsing precedence is one way to handle potentially redundant operators in the DSL and prune\\nsearch space. The other way is to explicitly write the equivalence relation on programs and\\nonly consider programs that are canonical representatives of each equivalence class [Osera and\\nZdancewic 2015; Smith and Albarghouthi 2019; Udupa et al. 2013]. The gDSL approach is low\\noverhead, but may consider equivalent programs during search. However, this is by design as our\\ngoal is to generate whatever program leads to most naturally readable code.\\nPrecedence of grammar rules can be viewed as a specialized case of probabilistic context-free\\ngrammars (pCFGs) that have been used to bias the enumeration of programs through their gram-\\nmar [Lee et al. 2018; Liang et al. 2010; Menon et al. 2013]. While specialized, precedence is actually\\npreferable in many scenarios where we want to synthesize not just any program that works on the\\ninput-output examples, but one that has other desirable properties, such as, the program generalizes\\nto unseen inputs and has a readable translation in target language. As such, precedence in gDSLs\\ngive designers of synthesizers a clean way to state their ranking preference. Weights in a pCFG\\nhave to be learned from data or manually set – both are daunting tasks compared to writing a gDSL.\\nThe contrast between pCFGs and gDSLs is akin to that between neural and symbolic approaches.\\nFlashFill [Gulwani 2011] demonstrated the effectiveness of inductive synthesis at tackling\\ncomplex string transformation. FlashMeta [Polozov and Gulwani 2015] recognized that many\\npopular inductive synthesizers [Gulwani 2011; Le and Gulwani 2014] could be decomposed into\\ndomain-specific features, such as the DSL operators and their semantics, and general (shareable)\\ndeductive steps. We used the FlashMeta framework to implement FlashFill, based on the original\\npaper [Gulwani 2011], for our experiments. We also built FlashFill++ the same way, which extends\\nthe capabilities of FlashFill to include new operations like date and number formatting, and also\\nfocuses on generating readable code.\\nIn recent work [Verbruggen et al. 2021], FlashFill has been combined with a pre-trained language\\nmodel (LM), GPT3, to facilitate semantic transformations, such as converting the city \"San Francisco\"\\nto the state \"CA\". Complementing FlashFill’s syntactic effectiveness with GPT3’s ability to do\\nsemantic transformation is interesting, but orthogonal to the problem here. However, we do exploit\\na LM to (optionally) generate meaningful variable names for our user study on code readability.\\nTrust and readability. Wrex [Drosos et al. 2020] argues that readable code is indispensable\\nfor users of synthesis technology. Wrex employed hand-written rewrite rules to produce readable\\ncode for their user study. However, this is not an approach that easily extends to all scenarios and\\nlarger languages. FlashFill++ is inspired by Wrex [Drosos et al. 2020] to address the readable code\\ngeneration challenge in a more general and scalable way: redesigning the DSL used with a focus\\non enabling readable code generation, rather than post-processing.\\nZhang et al [Zhang et al. 2021, 2020] introduced a system for interpretable synthesis, where the\\nuser interacts with the synthesizer. This approach is complementary to FlashFill++.\\n7.2\\nLimitations\\nThe concepts of cuts and precedence have been developed exclusively for synthesis approaches\\nbased on concrete values, so-called version space algebra (VSA) based methods, in this paper.

This is similar to how interpolants can be used to compute tight\\ninvariants in program verification when successive application of abstract transformers lead to\\noverly general invariants. Studying broader implications of these ideas is left for future work.\\nNontrivial cuts that go beyond bottom-up or top-down approaches can only be computed if there\\nare nontrivial invariants that hold (about the values that are generated) at certain intermediate\\nnonterminals in the grammar. Moreover, the DSL designer must be aware of these invariants. The\\nDSL designer can choose to write cuts that are incomplete in theory, but reasonable in practice,\\nguided by their understanding of the domain. Nontrivial cuts are likely to exist in large DSLs where\\ndifferent forms of values flow on different paths. We have not done a formal study of how difficult\\nit is for a DSL designer to write useful cut functions—this is beyond the scope of the current paper\\nwhich just lays down the foundations for cuts.\\nDesigning a guarded DSL requires the DSL designer to have clear preference for certain operators\\nover other alternatives, and moreover, any precedence on operators closer to the start symbol (in the\\ngrammar) should override any precedence on operators closer to the leaves of the program tree. The\\n“higher-up” operators in any DSL typically establish the high-level tactic of the program, and hence\\nthis requirement often holds. Precedences in a grammar are likely to exist if it contains redundant\\noperators that are some preferred compositions of other low-level operators in the grammar. Further,\\nthere are certain technical assumptions we make about precedences. The assumption that the\\nprecedence is a series-parallel partial order is not required if we start with the gDSL (rather than\\nstart with precedences), which is what we do in practice. The assumption that the reachability\\nrelation on the grammar nonterminals be acyclic is required only to provide a clean mathematical\\ninterpretation of the ranking induced by gDSL on programs (terms) as a path ordering. In the\\npresence of cycles, the synthesis rule and the full system can still be used without problems, but\\nranking cannot be described in a simple way.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe introduced two techniques, cuts and precedence through guarded DSLs, that DSL designers can\\nuse to prune search in programming by example. Cuts enable a novel synthesis strategy: middle-\\nout synthesis. This strategy allows FlashFill++ to support synthesis tasks that require non-EI/EE\\noperators, such as datetime and numeric transformations. The use of precedence through gDSLs\\nallows us to increase the size of our DSL, by incorporating redundant operators, which facilitate\\nreadable code generation in different target languages. We compare our tool to existing state-of-\\nthe-art PBE systems, FlashFill, Duet, and SmartFill, on three public benchmark datasets and show\\nthat FlashFill++ can solve more tasks, in less time, and without substantially increasing the number\\nof examples required. We also perform a survey-based study on code readability, confirming that\\nthe programs synthesized by FlashFill++ are more readable than those generated by FlashFill.\\nREFERENCES\\nAnnika Aasa. 1995.

TBCG is a popular technique in \\nmodel-driven engineering (MDE) given that they both emphasize abstraction and automa- \\ntion. Given the diversity of tools and approaches, it is necessary to classify existing TBCG \\ntechniques to better guide developers in their choices. \\nObjective: The goal of this article is to better understand the characteristics of TBCG tech- \\nniques and associated tools, identify research trends, and assess the importance of the role \\nof MDE in this code synthesis approach. \\nMethod: We survey the literature to paint an interesting picture about the trends and uses \\nof TBCG in research. To this end, we follow a systematic mapping study process. \\nResults: Our study shows, among other observations, that the research community has \\nbeen diversely using TBCG over the past 16 years. An important observation is that TBCG \\nhas greatly beneﬁted from MDE. It has favored a template style that is output-based and \\nhigh-level modeling languages as input. TBCG is mainly used to generate source code and \\nhas been applied to many domains. \\nConclusion: TBCG is now a mature technique and much research work is still conducted \\nin this area. However, some issues remain to be addressed, such as support for template \\ndeﬁnition and assessment of the correctness and quality of the generated code. \\n© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Since then, software organi- \\nzations have been relying on code synthesis techniques in order to reduce development time and increase productivity [2] . \\nAutomatically generating code is an approach where the same generator can be reused to produce many different artifacts \\naccording to the varying inputs it receives. It also helps detecting errors in the input artifact early on before the generated \\ncode is compiled, when the output is source code. \\nThere are many techniques to generate code, such as programmatically [3] , using a meta-object protocol [4] , or aspect- \\noriented programming [5] . Since the mid-1990’s, template-based code generation (TBCG) emerged as an approach requiring \\nless effort for the programmers to develop code generators. Templates favor reuse following the principle of write once, \\nproduce many . The concept was heavily used in web designer software (such as Dreamweaver) to generate web pages \\nand Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools to generate source code from UML diagrams.

TBCG is a popular technique in MDE given that they both emphasize abstraction and automation. MDE tools, \\nsuch as Acceleo 3 and Xpand 4 , allow developers to generate code from high-level models without worrying on how to parse \\nand traverse input models. We can ﬁnd today TBCG applied in a plethora of computer science and engineering research. \\nThe software engineering research community has focused essentially on primary studies proposing new TBCG tech- \\nniques, tools and applications. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no classiﬁcation, characterization, or \\nassessment of these studies available yet. Therefore, in this paper, we conducted a systematic mapping study (SMS) of \\nthe literature in order to understand the trends, identify the characteristics of TBCG, assess the popularity of existing tools \\nwithin the research community, and determine the inﬂuence that MDE has had on TBCG. We are interested in various \\nfacets of TBCG, such as characterizing the templates, the inputs, and outputs, along with the evolution of the amount of \\npublications using TBCG over the past 16 years. \\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 , we introduce the necessary background on TBCG \\nand discuss related work. In Section 3 , we elaborate on the methodology we followed for this SMS, and on the results of \\nthe paper selection phase. The following sections report the results: the trends and evolution of TBCG in Section 4 , the \\ncharacteristics of TBCG according to our classiﬁcation scheme in Section 5 , the relationships between the different facets \\nin Section 6 , how TBCG tools have been used in primary studies in Section 7 , and the relation between MDE and TBCG \\nin Section 8 . In Section 9 , we answer our research questions and discuss limitations of the study. Finally, we conclude in \\nSection 10 . \\n2. Background and related work \\nWe brieﬂy explain TBCG in the context of MDE and discuss related work on secondary studies about code generation. \\n2.1. Code generation \\nIn this paper, we view code generation as in automatic programming [1] rather than compilers. The underlying principle \\nof automatic programming is that a user deﬁnes what he expects from the program and the program should be automat- \\nically generated by a software without any assistance by the user. This generative approach is different from a compiler \\napproach. Compilers produce code executable by a computer from a speciﬁcation conforming to a programming language, \\nwhereas automatic programming transforms user speciﬁcations into code which often conforms to a programming language. \\nCompilers have a phase called code generation that retrieves an abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and translates it \\ninto machine code or bytecode executable by a virtual machine. Compared to code generation as in automatic programming, \\ncompilers can be regarded as tasks or services that are incorporated in or post-positioned to code generators [7] . \\nCode generation is an important model-to-text transformation that ensures the automatic transformation of a model into \\ncode. Organization are adopting the use of code generation since it reduces the development process time and increases \\nthe productivity. Generating the code using the most appropriate technique is even more crucial since it is the key to \\nbeneﬁt from all the advantages code synthesis offers to an organization. Nowadays, TBCG has raised to be the most popular \\nsynthesis technique available. Using templates can quickly become a complex task especially when the model should satisfy \\na certain condition before a template fragment is executed. \\nAs Balzer [8] states, there are many advantages to code generation. The effort of the user is reduced as he has fewer \\nlines to write: speciﬁcations are shorter than the program that implements them. Speciﬁcations are easier to write and \\nto understand for a user, given that they are closer to the application and domain concepts. Writing speciﬁcations is less \\nerror-prone than writing the program directly, since the expert is the one who writes the speciﬁcation rather than another \\nprogrammer. \\nThese advantages are in fact the pillar principles of MDE and domain-speciﬁc modeling. Floch et al. [9] observed many \\nsimilarities between MDE and compilers research and principles. Thus, it is not surprising to see that many, though not \\nexclusively, code generation tools came out of the MDE community. The advantages of code generation should be contrasted \\nwith some of its limitations. For example, there are issues related to integration of generated code with manually written \\ncode and to evolving speciﬁcations that require to re-generate the code [10] . Sometimes, relying too much on code genera- \\ntors may produce an overly general solution that may not necessarily be optimal for a speciﬁc problem. \\n1 https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx \\n2 http://velocity.apache.org/ \\n3 http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/ \\n4 http://wiki.eclipse.org/Xpand'),\n",

Components of TBCG. \\n2.2. Model-to-text transformations \\nIn MDE, model transformations can have different purposes [11] , such as translating, simulating, or reﬁning models. One \\nparticular kind of model transformation is devoted to code generation with model-to-text transformations (M2T) [12] . In \\ngeneral, M2T transforms a model (often in the form of a graph structure) into a linearized textual representation. M2T is \\nused to produce various text artifacts, e.g., to generate code, to serialize models, to generate documentation and reports, or \\nto visualize and explore models. As such, code generation is a special case of M2T, where the output artifacts are executable \\nsource code. There are commonly ﬁve different code generation approaches present in the literature [7,12] : \\nVisitor based approaches consist of programmatically traversing the internal representation of the input, while relying \\non an API dedicated to manipulate the input, to write the output to a text stream. This requires to program directly \\nthe creation of the output ﬁles and storing the strings while navigating through the data structure of the input. The \\nimplementation typically makes use of the visitor design pattern [13] . This approach is used in [3] to generate Java \\ncode from a software architecture description language. \\nMeta-programming is a language extension approach, such as using a meta-object protocol, that relies on introspection \\nin order to access the abstract syntax tree of the source program. For example, in OpenJava [4] , a Java meta-program \\ncreates a Java ﬁle, compiles it on the ﬂy, and loads the generated program in its own run-time. \\nIn-line generation relies on a preprocessor that generates additional code to expand the existing one, such as with the \\nC++ standard template library or C macro preprocessor instructions. The generation instructions can be deﬁned at a \\nhigher-level of abstraction, either using a dedicated language distinct from the base language (e.g., for macros) or as \\na dedicated library as in [14] . \\nCode annotations are in-line descriptions that added to statement declarations (e.g., class deﬁnition) that can either be \\ninternally transformed into more expanded code (e.g., attributes in C#) or that are processed by a tool other than the \\ncompiler of the language (e.g., the speciﬁcation of documentation comments processed by Javadoc). This approach is \\nused in [15] . \\nTemplate based is described below. \\n2.3. Template-based code generation \\nThe literature agrees on a general deﬁnition of M2T code generation [12] and on templates. Jörges [7] identiﬁes three \\ncomponents in TBCG: the data, the template, and the output. However, there is another component that is not mentioned, \\nwhich is the meta-information the generation logic of the template relies on. Therefore, we conducted this study according \\nto the following notion of TBCG. \\nFigure 1 summarizes the main concepts of TBCG. We consider TBCG as a synthesis technique that uses templates in order \\nto produce a textual artifact, such as source code, called the output . A template is an abstract and generalized representation \\nof the textual output it describes. It has a static part , text fragments that appear in the output “as is”. It also has a dynamic \\npart embedded with splices of meta-code that encode the generation logic. Templates are executed by the template engine \\n(sometimes refereed to as template processor ) to compute the dynamic part and replace meta-codes by static text according \\nto run-time input . The design-time input deﬁnes the meta-information which the run-time input conforms to. The dynamic \\npart of a template relies on the design-time input to query the run-time input by ﬁltering the information retrieved and \\nperforming iterative expansions on it. Therefore, TBCG relies on a design-time input that is used to deﬁne the template \\nand a run-time input on which the template is applied to produce the output. For example, a TBCG engine that takes as \\nrun-time input an XML document relies on an XML schema as design-time input. Deﬁnition 1 summarizes our deﬁnition of \\nTBCG.'),\n",

Syriani et al. / Computer Languages, Systems & Structures 52 (2018) 43–62 \\nDeﬁnition 1. A synthesis technique is a TBCG if it consists of a set of templates speciﬁed in a formalism, where the speciﬁ- \\ncation of a template is based on a design-time input such that, when executed, it reads a run-time input to produce a textual \\noutput . \\nFor example, the work in [16] generates a C# API from Ecore models using Xpand. According to Deﬁnition 1 , the tem- \\nplates of this TBCG example are Xpand templates, the design-time input is the metamodel of Ecore, the run-time input is \\nan Ecore model, and the output is a C# project ﬁle and C# classes. \\n2.4. Literature reviews on code generation \\nIn evidence-based software engineering [17] , a systematic literature review is a secondary study that reviews primary \\nstudies with the aim of synthesizing evidence related to a speciﬁc research question. Several forms of systematic reviews \\nexist depending on the depth of reviewing primary studies and on the speciﬁcities of research questions. Unlike conven- \\ntional systematic literature reviews that attempt to answer a speciﬁc question, a SMS aim at classifying and performing a \\nthematic analysis on a topic [18] . SMS is a secondary study method that has been adapted from other disciplines to soft- \\nware engineering in [19] and later evolved by Petersen et al. in [20] . A SMS is designed to provide a wide overview of \\na research area, establish if research evidence exists on a speciﬁc topic, and provide an indication of the quantity of the \\nevidence speciﬁc to the domain. \\nOver the years, there have been many primary studies on code generation. However, we could not ﬁnd any secondary \\nstudy on TBCG explicitly. Still, the following are closely related secondary studies. \\nMehmood et al. [21] performed a SMS regarding the use of aspect-oriented modeling for code generation, which is not \\nbased on templates. They analyzed 65 papers mainly based on three main categories: the focus area, the type of research, \\nand the type of contribution. The authors concluded that this synthesis technique is still immature. The study shows that \\nno work has been reported to use or evaluate any of the techniques proposed. \\nGurunule et al. [22] presented a comparison of aspect orientation and MDE techniques to investigate how they can each \\nbe used for code generation. The authors found that further research in these areas can lead to signiﬁcant advancements in \\nthe development of software systems. Unlike Mehmood et al. [21] , they did not follow a systematic and repeatable process. \\nDominguez et al. [23] performed a systematic literature review of studies that focus on code generation from state ma- \\nchine speciﬁcations. The study is based on a set of 53 papers, which have been classiﬁed into two groups: pattern-based \\nand not pattern-based. The authors do not take template-based approaches into consideration. \\nBatot et al. [24] performed a systematic mapping study on model transformations solving a concrete problem that have \\nbeen published in the literature. They analyzed 82 papers based on a classiﬁcation scheme that is general to any model \\ntransformation approach, which includes M2T. They conclude that concrete model transformations have been pulling out \\nfrom the research literature since 2009 and are being considered as development tasks. They also found that 22% of their \\ncorpus solve concrete problems using reﬁnement and code synthesis techniques. Finally, they found that research in model \\ntransformations is heading for a more stable and grounded validation. \\nThere are other studies that attempted to classify code generation techniques. However, they did not follow a systematic \\nand repeatable process. For example, Czarnecki et al. [12] proposed a feature model providing a terminology to characterize \\nmodel transformation approaches. They distinguished two categories for M2T approaches: those that are visitor-based and \\nthose that are template-based; the latter being in line with Deﬁnition 1 . The authors found that many new approaches \\nto model-to-model transformation have been proposed recently, but relatively little experience is available to assess their \\neffectiveness in practical applications. \\nRose et al. [25] extended the feature model of Czarnecki et al. to focus on template-based M2T tools. Their classiﬁcation \\nis centered exclusively on tool-dependent features. Their goal is to help developers when they are faced to choose between \\ndifferent tools. This study is close to the work of Czarnecki in [12] but focuses only on a feature model for M2T. The \\ndifference with our study is that it focuses on a feature diagram and deals with tool-dependent features only. \\nThere are also other systematic reviews performed on other related topics. For example, the study in [26] performed a \\nSMS on domain-speciﬁc modeling languages (DSL). They analyzed 390 papers to portray the published literature on DSLs, \\nwhich is comparable to the size of our corpus. Also, the study in [27] presents a systematic literature review on software \\nproduct lines engineering in the context of DSLs. Similar to our study, they propose a deﬁnition for the life-cycle of language \\nproduct lines and use it to analyze how the literature has an impact this life-cycle. Another SMS recently published in \\n[28] presents a taxonomy of source code labeling. \\n3. Research methods \\nIn order to analyze the topic of TBCG, we conducted a SMS following the process deﬁned by Petersen et al. in [20] and \\nsummarized in Fig. 2 . The deﬁnition of research question is discussed in Section 3.1 . The search conduction is described \\nin Section 3.2 . We present the screening of papers in Section 3.3 . The relevant papers are obtained based on the criteria \\npresented in Section 3.3.1 and Section 3.3.2 . The elaboration of the classiﬁcation scheme is described in Section 3.4 . Finally, \\nwe detail the selection of the papers in Section 3.5 .'),\n",

The systematic mapping study process we followed from Peterson et al. \\n3.1. Objectives \\nThe objective of this study is to obtain an overview of the current research in the area of TBCG and to characterize the \\ndifferent approaches that have been developed. We deﬁned four research questions to set the scope of this study: \\n1. What are the trends in template-based code generation? We are interested to know how this technique has evolved over \\nthe years through research publications. \\n2. What are the characteristics of template-based code generation approaches? We want to identify major characteristics of \\nthese techniques and their tendencies. \\n3. To what extent are template-based code generation tools being used in research? We are interested in identifying popular \\ntools and their uses. \\n4. What is the place of MDE in template-based code generation? We seek to determine whether and how MDE has inﬂuenced \\nTBCG. \\n3.2. Selection of source \\nWe delimited the scope of the search to be regular publications that mention TBCG as at least one of the approaches \\nused for code generation and published between 20 0 0–2016. Therefore, this includes publications where code generation is \\nnot necessarily the main contribution. For example, Buchmann et al. [29] used TBCG to obtain ATL code while their main \\nfocus was implementing a higher-order transformation. Given that not all publications have the term “code generation” in \\ntheir title, we retrieved publications based on their title, abstract, or full text (when available) mentioning the keywords \\n“template” and its variations, “code”, and “generation” and synonyms with their variations (e.g., “synthesis”). We used the \\nfollowing search query for all digital libraries, using their respective syntax: \\ntemplat ∗AND “code generat ∗” OR “code synthesi ∗”\\nWe validated our search with a sample of 100 pilot papers we preselected. These papers were chosen from papers we \\napriori knew should be included and resulting from a preliminary pilot search online. We iterated over different versions of \\nthe search strings until all pilot papers could be retrieved from the digital libraries. \\n3.3. Screening procedure \\nScreening is the most crucial phase in a SMS [20] . We followed a two-stage screening procedure: automatic ﬁltering, \\nthen title and abstract screening. In order to avoid the exclusion of papers that should be part of the ﬁnal corpus, we \\nfollowed a strict screening procedure. With four reviewers at our disposal, each article is screened by at least two reviewers \\nindependently. When both reviewers of a paper disagree upon the inclusion or exclusion of the paper, a physical discussion \\nis required. If the conﬂict is still unresolved, an additional senior reviewer is involved in the discussion until a consensus \\nis reached. To determine a fair exclusion process, a senior reviewer reviews a sample of no less than 20% of the excluded \\npapers at the end of the screening phase, to make sure that no potential paper is missed. \\n3.3.1. Inclusion criteria \\nA paper is included if it explicitly indicates the use of TBCG or if it proposes a TBCG technique. We also include papers \\nif the name of a TBCG tool appears in the title, abstract, or content. “Use” is taken in a large sense when it is explicit that \\na TBCG contributes to the core of the paper (not in the related work). \\n3.3.2. Exclusion criteria \\nResults from the search were ﬁrst ﬁltered automatically to discard records that were outside the scope of this study: \\npapers not in computer science, not in the software engineering domain, with less than two pages of length (e.g., proceed-'),\n",

Then, papers were excluded through manual inspection based on the following criteria: \\n• No code generation. There is no code generation technique used. \\n• Not template-based code generation. Code generation is mentioned, but the considered technique is not template-based \\naccording to Deﬁnition 1 . \\n• Not a paper. This exclusion criterion spans papers that were not caught by the automatic ﬁltering. For example, some \\npapers had only the abstract written in English and the content of the paper in another language. Additionally, there \\nwere 24 papers where the full text was not accessible online. \\nFor the ﬁrst two criteria, when the abstract did not give enough details about the code generation approach, a quick \\nlook at the full text helped clear any doubts on whether to exclude the paper or not. Reviewers were conservative on that \\nmatter. \\n3.4. Classiﬁcation scheme \\nWe elaborated a classiﬁcation scheme by combining our general knowledge with the information extracted from the \\nabstracts during the screening phase. We classify all papers along different categories that are of interest in order to answer \\nour research questions. This helps analyzing the overall results and gives an overview of the trends and characteristics of \\nTBCG. The categories we classiﬁed the corpus with are the following: \\n• Template style : We characterize the level of customization and expressiveness of the templates used in the code gen- \\neration approach. Predeﬁned style is reserved for approaches where the template used for code generation is deﬁned \\ninternally to the tool. However, a subset of the static part of the template is customizable to vary slightly the gener- \\nated output. This is, for example, the case for common CASE tools where there is a predeﬁned template to synthesize \\na class diagram into a number of programming languages. Nevertheless, the user can specify what construct to use for \\nmany-cardinality associations, e.g., Array or ArrayList for Java templates. Output-based style covers templates that \\nare syntactically based on the actual target output. In contrast with the previous style, output-based templates offer full \\ncontrol on how the code is generated, both on the static and dynamic parts. The generation logic is typically encoded in \\nmeta-code as in the example of Fig. 1 . Rule-based style puts the focus of the template on computing the dynamic part \\nwith the static part being implicit. The template lists declarative production rules that are applied on-demand by the \\ntemplate engine to obtain the ﬁnal target output. For example, this is used to render the concrete textual syntax from \\nthe abstract syntax of a model using a grammar. \\n• Input type : We characterize the language of the design-time input that is necessary to develop templates. The run-time \\ninput is an instance that conforms to it. General-purpose modeling language is for generic languages reusable across dif- \\nferent domains that are not programming languages, such as UML. Domain-speciﬁc modeling language is for languages \\ntargeted for a particular domain, for example, where the run-time input is a Simulink model. Schema is for structured \\ndata deﬁnitions, such as XML or database schema. Programming language is for well-deﬁned programming languages, \\nwhere the run-time input is source code. \\n• Output type : We characterize the output of the code generator (more than one category can be selected when multiple \\nartifacts are generated). Source code is executable code conforming to a speciﬁc programming language. Structured data \\nis for code that is not executable, such as HTML. \\n• Application scale : We characterize the scale of the artifact on which the TBCG approach is applied with respect to the \\nevaluation or illustration cases in the paper. The presence of a formal case study that either relied on multiple data \\nsources or subjects qualiﬁed as large scale application. Small scale was used mainly when there was only one example or \\ntoy examples in the paper that illustrated the TBCG. No application if for when the code generation was not applied on \\nany example. \\n• Application domain : We classify the general domain TBCG has been applied on. For example, this includes Software engi- \\nneering, Embedded systems, Compilers, Bio-medicine , etc. \\n• Orientation : We distinguish industrial papers, where at least one author is aﬃliated to industry, from academic papers \\notherwise. \\n• Tool : We capture the tool used for TBCG. If a tool is not clearly identiﬁed in a paper or the TBCG is programmed directly, \\nwe classify the tool as unspeciﬁed . We consider a tool to be popular within the research community when it is used in \\nat least 1% of the papers. Otherwise, we classify it as other . \\n• MDE : We determine whether the part of the solution where TBCG is applied in the paper follows MDE techniques and \\nprinciples. A good indication is if the design-time input is a metamodel. \\n3.5. Paper selection \\nTable 1 summarizes the ﬂow of information through the selection process of this study.

Paper collection \\nThe paper collection step was done in two phases: querying and automatic duplicates removal. There are several \\nonline databases that index software engineering literature. For this study, we considered three main databases to maxi- \\nmize coverage: Engineering Village 5 , Scopus 6 , and SpringerLink 7 . The ﬁrst two cover typical software engineering editors \\n( IEEE Xplore , ACM Digital Library , Elsevier ). However, from past experiences [24] , they do not include all of Springer pub- \\nlications. We used the search string from Section 3.2 to retrieve all papers from these three databases. We obtained 7 646 \\ncandidate papers that satisfy the query and the options of the search stated in Section 3.3.2 . We then removed automatically \\nall duplicates using EndNote software. This resulted in 5 131 candidate papers for the screening phase. \\n3.5.2. Screening \\nBased on the exclusion criteria stated in Section 3.3.2 , each candidate paper was screened by at least two reviewers to \\ndecide on its inclusion. To make the screening phase more eﬃcient, we used a home-made tool [30] . After all the reviewers \\ncompleted screening the papers they were assigned, the tool calculates an inter-rater agreement coeﬃcient. In our case, the \\nCohens Kappa coeﬃcient was 0.813. This high value shows that the reviewers were in almost perfect agreement. \\nAmong the initial corpus of candidate papers, 4556 were excluded, 551 were included and 24 received conﬂicting ratings. \\nDuring the screening, the senior reviewer systematically veriﬁed each set of 100 rejected papers for sanity check. A total \\nof 7 more papers were included back hence the rejected papers were reduced to 4549. Almost all cases of conﬂicts were \\nabout a disagreement on whether the code generation technique of a paper was using templates or not. These conﬂicts were \\nresolved in physical meetings and 20 of them were ﬁnally included for a total of 578 papers and 4553 excluded. \\nAmong the excluded papers, 52% were rejected because no code generation was used. We were expecting such a high \\nrate because terms such as “templates” are used in many other ﬁelds, like biometrics. Also, many of these papers were \\nreferring to the C++ standard template library [31] , which is not about code generation. We counted 34% papers excluded \\nbecause they were not using templates . Examples of such papers are cited in Section 2.2 . Also, more than a quarter of the \\npapers were in the compilers or embedded system domains, where code generation is programmed imperatively rather than \\ndeclaratively speciﬁed using a template mechanism. Finally, 5% of the papers were considered as not a paper . In fact, this \\ncriterion was in place to catch papers that escaped the automatic ﬁltering from the databases. \\n3.5.3. Eligibility during classiﬁcation \\nOnce the screening phase over, we thoroughly analyzed the full text of the remaining 578 papers to classify them \\naccording to our classiﬁcation scheme. Doing so allowed us to conﬁrm that the code generation approach was effectively \\ntemplate-based according to Deﬁnition 1 . We encountered papers that used multiple TBCG tools: they either compared tools \\nor adopted different tools for different tasks. We classiﬁed each of these papers as a single publication, but incremented the \\noccurrence corresponding to the tools referred to in the paper. This is the case of [32] where the authors use Velocity and \\nXSLT for code generation. Velocity generates Java and SQL code, while XSLT generates the control code. \\nWe excluded 99 additional papers. During screening, we detected situations where the abstract suggested the imple- \\nmentation of TBCG, whereas the full text proved otherwise. In most of the cases, the meaning of TBCG differed from the \\ndescription presented in Section 2.3 . As shown in [33] the terms template-based and generation are used in the context of \\nnetworking and distributed systems. We also encountered circumstances where the tool mentioned in the abstract requires \\nthe explicit use of another component to be considered as TBCG, such as Simulink TLC, as in [34] . \\nThe ﬁnal corpus 8 considered for this study contains 481 papers. \\n5 https://www.engineeringvillage.com/ \\n6 https://www.scopus.com/ \\n7 http://link.springer.com/ \\n8 The complete list of papers is available online at http://www-ens.iro.umontreal.ca/ ∼luhunukl/survey/classiﬁcation.html'),\n",

Evolution of TBCG \\nWe start with a thorough analysis of the trends in TBCG in order to answer the ﬁrst research question. \\n4.1. General trend \\nFigure 3 reports the number of papers per year, averaging around 28. The general trend indicates that the number of \\npublications with at least one TBCG method started increasing in 2002 to reach a ﬁrst local maximum in 2005 and then \\nremained relatively constant until 2012. This increase coincides with the early stages of MDE and the ﬁrst edition of the \\nModels conference, previous called Uml conference. This is a typical trend where a research community gets carried away \\nby the enthusiasm of a new potentially interesting domain, which leads to more publications. However, the most proliﬁc \\nperiod was in 2013, where we notice a signiﬁcant peak with 2.4 times the average numbers of publications observed in the \\nprevious years. Fig. 3 then shows sudden a decrease in 2015. \\nResorting to statistical methods, the high coeﬃcient of variability and modiﬁed Thompson Tau test indicate that 2013 \\nand 2015 are outliers in the range 2005–2016, where the average is 37 papers per year. The sudden isolated peak in 2013 \\nis the result of a special event or popularity of TBCG. The following decrease in the amount of papers published should not \\nbe interpreted as a decline in interest in TBCG, but that some event happened around 2013 which boosted publications, \\nand then it went back to the steady rate of publication as previous years. In fact, 2016 is one standard deviation above the \\naverage. \\n4.2. Publications and venues \\nWe analyzed the papers based on the type of publication and the venue of their publication. MDE venues account for \\nonly 22% of the publications, so are software engineering venues, while the majority (56%) were published in other venues. \\nTable 2 shows the most popular venues that have at least ﬁve papers. These top venues account for just more than a quarter \\nof the total number of publications. Among them, MDE venues account for 60% of the papers. Models , Sosym , and Ecmfa \\nare the three most popular venues 9 with a total of 66 publications between them. This is very signiﬁcant given that the \\n9 We grouped Uml conference with Models and Ecmda-fa with Ecmfa .'),\n",

Also, 43% of venues had only one paper using TBCG, \\nwhich is the case for most of the other venues. \\nThe peak in 2013 was mainly inﬂuenced by MDE and software engineering venues. However the drop in 2015 is the result \\nof an accumulation of the small variations among the other venues. Since 2014, MDE venues account for 10–12 papers per \\nyear, while only 6–7 in software engineering. \\nAs for the publication type, conference publications have been dominating at 64%. Journal article account for 24% of all \\npapers. The remaining papers were published as book chapters, workshops or other publication type. Interestingly, we notice \\na steady increase in journal articles, reaching a maximum of 15 in 2016. \\n5. Characteristics of template-based code generation \\nWe examine the characteristics of TBCG using the classiﬁcation scheme presented in Section 3.4 . \\n5.1. Template style \\nAs Table 3 illustrates, the vast majority of the publications follow the output-based style. This consists of papers like [35] , \\nwhere Xpand is used to generate workﬂow code used to automate modeling tools. There, it is the ﬁnal output target text \\nthat drives the development of the template. This high score is expected since output-based style is the original template \\nstyle for TBCG as depicted in Fig. 4 . This style has always been the most popular style since 20 0 0. \\nThe predeﬁned style is the second most popular. Most of these papers generate code using a CASE tool, such as [36] that \\nuses Rhapsody to generate code to map UML2 semantics to Java code with respect to association ends. Apart from CASE \\ntools, we also classiﬁed papers like [37] as predeﬁned style since the output code is already ﬁxed as HTML and the pro- \\ngrammer uses the tags to change some values based on the model. Each year, around 28% of the papers were using the \\npredeﬁned style, except for a peak of 39% in 2005, given the popularity of CASE tools then. \\nWe found 19 publications that used rule-based style templates. This includes papers like [38] which generates Java code \\nwith Stratego from a DSL. A possible explanation of such a low score is that this is the most diﬃcult template style to \\nimplement. It had a maximum of two papers per year throughout the study period. \\n5.2. Input type \\nGeneral purpose languages account for almost half of the design-time input of the publications, as depicted in Table 4 . \\nUML (class) diagrams, which are used as metamodels for code generation, are the most used for 87% of these papers as in \\n[35] . Other popular general-purpose languages that were used are, for example, the architecture analysis and design lan- \\nguage [39] and feature diagrams [40] . The schema category comes second with 21% of the papers. For example, a database \\nTable 4 \\nDistribution of the input type facet. \\nGeneral purpose \\nSchema \\nDomain speciﬁc \\nProgramming language \\n48% \\n22% \\n20% \\n10%'),\n",

Evolution of the design-time input type. \\nschema is used as input at design-time in [41] to generate Java for a system that demonstrates that template can im- \\nprove software development. Also, an XML schema is used in [42] as design-time input to produce C programs in order to \\nimplement an approach that can eﬃciently support all the conﬁguration options of an application in embedded systems. \\nDSLs are almost at par with schema. They have been gaining popularity and gradually reducing the gap with general-purpose \\nlanguages. For example in [43] , a custom language is given as the design input in order to generate C and C++ to develop \\na TBCG approach dedicated to real-time systems. The least popular design-time input type is programming language . This \\nincludes papers like [44] where T4 is used to generate hardware description (VHDL) code for conﬁgurable hardware. In this \\ncase, the input is another program on which the template depends. \\nOver the years, the general-purpose category has dominated the input type facet, as depicted in Fig. 5 . 2003 and 2006 \\nwere the only exceptions where schema obtained slightly more publications. We also notice a shift from schema to domain- \\nspeciﬁc design-time input types. Domain-speciﬁc input started increasing in 2009 but never reached the same level as \\ngeneral purpose. Programming language input maintained a constant level, with an average of 1% per year. Interestingly, in \\n2011, there were more programming languages used than DSLs. \\n5.3. Output type \\nAn overwhelming majority of the papers use TBCG to generate source code (81%), in contrast with 19% was structured \\ndata (though some papers output both types). Table 5 shows the distribution of the output languages that appeared in more \\nthan ﬁve papers, representing 74% of the corpus. This includes papers like [45] where Java code is generated an adaptable \\naccess control tool for electronic medical records. Java and C are the most targeted programming languages. Writing a \\nprogram manually often requires proved abilities, especially with system and hardware languages, such as VHDL [46] . This \\nis why 8% of all papers generate low level source codes. Generation of structured data includes TBCG of mainly XML and \\nHTML ﬁles. For example [47] produces both HTML and XML as parts of the web component to ease regression testing. In \\naddition, we found that around 4% of the papers generate combinations of at least two output types. This includes papers \\nsuch as [48] that generate both C# and HTML from a domain-speciﬁc model. \\nStructured data output remained constant over the years, unlike source code which follows the general trend. \\n5.4. Application scale \\nAs depicted in Table 6 , most papers applied TBCG on large scale examples. This result indicates that TBCG is a technique \\nwhich scales with larger amounts of data. This includes papers like [49] that uses Acceleo to generate hundreds of lines \\nTable 5 \\nDistribution of the most popular output languages. \\nJava \\nC \\nHTML \\nC ++ \\nC# \\nXML \\nVHDL \\nSQL \\nAspectJ \\nSystemC \\n33% \\n11% \\n7% \\n7% \\n4% \\n3% \\n3% \\n2% \\n2% \\n2% \\nTable 6 \\nDistribution of application scale facet \\nLarge scale \\nSmall scale \\nNo application \\n63% \\n32% \\n5%'),\n",

This includes papers like [51] where authors just mention that code synthesis is performed using a tool named \\nMako-template. Even though the number of publications without an actual application is very low, this demonstrates that \\nsome authors have still not adopted good practice to show an example of the implementation. This is important, especially \\nwhen the TBCG approach is performed with a newly developed tool. \\nAs depicted in Fig. 6 , most papers illustrated their TBCG using large scale applications up to 2015. In this period, while \\nit follows the general trend of papers, the other two categories remained constant over the years. However, in 2016, we \\nobserve a major increase of small scale for TBCG. \\n5.5. Application domain \\nThe tree map in Fig. 7 highlights the fact that TBCG is used in many different areas. Software engineering obtains more \\nthan half of the papers with 55% of the publications. We have grouped in this category other related areas like ontolo- \\ngies, information systems or software product lines. This is expected given that the goal of TBCG is to synthesize software \\napplications. For example, the work in [52] uses the Rational CASE tool to generate Java programs in order to implement an \\napproach that transforms UML state machine to behavioral code. The next category is embedded systems which obtains 13% \\nof papers. Embedded systems often require low level hardware code diﬃcult to write. Some even consider code generation \\nto VHDL as a compilation rather than automatic programming. In this category, we found papers like [53] in which Velocity \\nis used to produce Verilog code to increase the speed of simulation. Web technology related application domains account for \\n8% of the papers. It consists of papers like [54] where the authors worked to enhance the development dynamic web sites. \\nNetworking obtains 4% of the papers, such as [55] where code is generated for a telephony service network. Compiler obtains \\n1% of the papers, such as [56] where a C code is generated and optimized for an Intel C compiler. It is interesting to note \\nthat several papers were applied in domains such as bio-medicine [57] , artiﬁcial intelligence [58] , and graphics [59] . \\n10 http://www.eclipse.org/epsilon/doc/egl/'),\n",

Syriani et al. / Computer Languages, Systems & Structures 52 (2018) 43–62 \\nWe combined application domains with a single paper into the other category. This regroups domains such as agronomy, \\neducation, and ﬁnance. It is important to mention that the domain discussed in this category corresponds to the domain of \\napplication of TBCG employed, which differs from the publication venue. \\n5.6. Orientation \\nA quarter (24%) of the papers in the corpus are authored by a researcher from industry . The remaining 76% are written \\nonly by academics . This is a typical distribution since industrials tend to not publish their work. This result shows that TBCG \\nis used in industry as in [16] . Industry oriented papers have gradually increased since 2003 until they reached a peak in \\n2013. \\n6. Relations between characteristics \\nTo further characterize the trends observed in Section 5 , we identiﬁed signiﬁcant and interesting relations between the \\ndifferent facets of the classiﬁcation scheme, using SPSS. \\n6.1. Statistical correlations \\nA Shapiro–Wilk test of each category determined that the none of them are normally distributed. Therefore, we opted \\nfor the Spearman two-tailed test of non-parametric correlations with a signiﬁcance value of 0.05 to identify correlations \\nbetween the trends of each category. The only signiﬁcantly strong correlations we found statistically are between the two \\ninput types, and between MDE and input type. \\nWith no surprise, the correlation between run-time and design time input is the strongest among all, with a correlation \\ncoeﬃcient of 0.944 and a p- value of less than 0.001. This concurs with the results found in Section 5.2 . An example is \\nwhen the design-time input is UML, the run-time input is always a UML diagram as in [57] . Such a strong relationship is \\nalso noticeable in [60] with programming languages and source code, as well as in [58] when a schema design is used for \\nstructured data. As a result, all run-time input categories are correlated to the same categories as for design-time input. We \\nwill therefore treat these two facets together as input type . \\nThere is a strong correlation of coeﬃcient of 0.738 and a p-value of less than 0.001 between input type and MDE . As \\nexpected, more than 90% of the papers using general purpose and domain speciﬁc inputs are follow the MDE approach. \\n6.2.

Input type \\nThe bubble chart in Fig. 9 illustrates the tendencies between input and output types. It is clear that source code is \\nthe dominant generated artifact regardless of the input type. Source code is more often generated from general purpose \\nand domain speciﬁc inputs than from schema and programming languages. Also, the largest portion of structured data is \\ngenerated from a schema input. \\nMoving on to input type and application scale, we found that small scales are used 40% of the time when the input is a \\nprogramming language. The number of papers with no sample application is very low (5%) regardless of the template style. \\nFinally, 74% of papers using large scale applications use a domain speciﬁc input, which is slightly higher than those using a \\ngeneral purpose input with 71%. \\n6.2.3. Output type, application scale, and orientation \\nAs we compared output type to orientation, we found that industrials generate slightly more source code than academics: \\n89% vs. 80%. However, academics generate more structured data than industrials: 18% vs. 6% and 3% vs. 1%., respectively. We \\nfound that 65% of the papers without application are from the academy. \\n7. Template-based code generation tools \\nTable 7 shows that half of the papers used a popular TBCG tool ( named ). The other half used less popular tools (the other \\ncategory), did not mention any TBCG tool, or implemented the code generation directly for the purpose of the paper. \\n7.1. Popular tools in research \\nFigure 10 shows the distribution of popular tools used in at least 1% of the papers, i.e., ﬁve papers. We see that only \\n6/14 popular tools follow MDE approaches. Acceleo and Xpand are the most popular with respectively 16% and 15% of the \\npapers using them. Their popularity is probably due to their simple syntax and ease of use [61] and the fact that they are \\nMDE tools [16] . They both have an OCL-like language for the dynamic part and rely on a metamodel speciﬁed in Ecore as \\ndesign-time input.'),\n",

Syriani et al. / Computer Languages, Systems & Structures 52 (2018) 43–62 \\nFig. 10. Popular tools. \\nEGL also has a structure similar to the other model-based tools. It is natively integrated with languages from the Epsilon \\nfamily, thus relies on the Epsilon Object Language for its dynamic part. MOFScript is another popular model-based tool that \\nonly differs in syntax from the others. Xtend2 is the least used popular model-based tool. It is both an advanced form of \\nXpand and a simpliﬁed syntactical version of Java. \\nXSLT is the third most popular tool used. It is suitable for XML documents only. Some use it for models represented in \\ntheir XMI format, as it is the case in [62] . XSLT follows the template and ﬁltering strategy. It matches each tag of the input \\ndocument and applies the corresponding template. \\nJET [63] and Velocity [53] are used as often as each other on top of being quite similar. The main difference is that JET \\nuses an underlying programming language (Java) for the dynamic part. In JET, templates are used to developers generate the \\nJava code speciﬁc for the synthesis of code to help developers implement the code generation. \\nStringTemplate [64] has its own template structure. It can be embedded into a Java code where strings to be output are \\ndeﬁned using templates. Note that all the tools mentioned above use an output-based template style. \\nThe most popular CASE tools for TBCG are Fujaba [65] , Rational [66] , and Rhapsody [67] . One of the features they offer is \\nto generate different target languages from individual UML elements. All CASE tools (even counting the other category) have \\nbeen used in a total of 39 papers, which puts them at par with Xpand. CASE tools are mostly popular for design activities; \\ncode generation is only one of their many features. CASE tools have a predeﬁned template style. \\nSimulink TLC is the only rule-based tool among the most popular ones. As a rule-based approach, it has a different \\nstructure compared to the above mentioned tools. Its main difference is that the developer writes the directives to be \\nfollowed by Simulink in order to render the ﬁnal C code from S-functions. \\nWe notice that the most popular tools are evenly distributed between model-based tools (Acceleo, Xpand) and code- \\nbased tools (JET, XSLT). Surprisingly, XSLT, which has been around the longest, is less popular than Xpand. This is undoubt- \\nedly explained by the advantages that MDE has to offer [7,8] . \\n7.2. Unspeciﬁed and other tools \\nAs depicted in Table 7 , 28% of the papers did not specify the tool that was used, as in [68] where the authors introduce \\nthe concept of a meta-framework to resolve issues involved in extending the life of applications. Furthermore, 23% of the \\npapers used less popular tools, present in less than ﬁve papers, such as T4 [44] and Cheetah [56] , a python powered template \\nmainly used for web developing. Like JET, Cheetah templates generate Python classes, while T4 is integrated with .NET \\ntechnology. Some CASE tools were also in this category, such as AndroMDA [69] . Other examples of less popular tools are \\nGroovy template [47] , Meta-Aspect-J [70] , and Jinja2 [71] . The fact that new or less popular tools are still abundantly used \\nsuggests that research in TBCG is still active with new tools being developed or evolved. \\n7.3. Trends of tools used \\nEach one of these tools had a different evolution over the years. Unspeciﬁed tools were prevalent before 2004 and then \\nkept a constant rate of usage until a drop since 2014. We notice a similar trend for CASE tools that were the most popular \\nin 2005 before decreasing until 2009. They only appear in at most three papers per year after 2010. The use of the most \\npopular tool, Xpand, gradually increased since 2005 to reach the peak in 2013 before decreasing. The other category main- \\ntained an increasing trend until 2014. Yet, a few other popular tools appeared later on. For example, EGL started appearing \\nin 2008 and had its peak in 2013. Acceleo appeared a year later and was the most popular TBCG tool in 2013–2014. Finally,'),\n",

StringTemplate and T4 were used scarcely since 2006 and 2009, \\nrespectively. \\n7.4. Characteristics of tools \\nWe have also analyzed each popular tool with respect to the characteristics presented in Section 5 . As mentioned earlier, \\nmost of the popular tools implement output-based template technique except the CASE tools which are designed following \\nthe predeﬁned style. \\nTools such as Acceleo, Xpand, EGL, MOFScript and 97% of the CASE tools papers are only used based on an MDE ap- \\nproach, given that they were created by this community. Nevertheless, there are tools that were never used with MDE \\nprinciples, like JET and Cheetah. Such tools can handle a program code or a schema as metamodel but have no internal \\nsupport for modeling languages. Moreover, the programmer has to write his own stream reader to parse the input, but they \\nallow for a broader range of artifacts as inputs that do not have to be modeled explicitly. A few code-based tools provide \\ninternal support for model-based approaches. For instance, Velocity, XSLT, and StringTemplate can handle both UML and pro- \\ngrammed metamodel as design-time input. T4 can be integrated with MDE artifacts (e.g., generate code based on a domain- \\nspeciﬁc language in Visual studio). However, all four papers in the corpus that implemented TBCG in T4 did not use an MDE \\napproach. \\nA surprising result we found is that EGL is the only MDE tool that has its papers mostly published in MDE venues like \\nSosym , Models , and Ecmfa . All the other tools are mostly published in other venues like Icssa , whereas software engineering \\nvenues, like Ase or Icse , and MDE venues account for 26–33% of the papers for each of the rest of the MDE tools. \\nCASE tools, MOFScript, Velocity, and Simulink TLC mostly generate program code. The latter is always used in the domain \\nof embedded systems. Papers that use StringTemplate do not include any validation process, so is Velocity in 93% of the \\npapers using it. XSLT has been only used to generate structured data as anticipated. \\nOther tools are the most used TBCG in the industry. This is because the tool is often internal to the company [72] . Among \\nthe most popular tools, Xpand is the most in the industry. \\n7.5. Application scale \\nBetween application scale and tools, we found that 74% of the papers that make use of a popular tool used large scale \\napplication to illustrate their approach. Also, 62% of the papers using unpopular tools 11 use large scale applications. Small \\nscale is likely to be used in unpopular tools rather than popular tools. \\n7.6. Tool support \\nIn total, we found 82 different tools named in the corpus. Among them 54% are no longer supported (i.e., no release, \\nupdate or commit since the past two years). Interestingly, 55% of the tools have been developed by the industry. 70% of \\nthese industry tools are still supported, in contrast with 51% for the academic tools. As one would expect, the tendency \\nshows that tools that are frequently mentioned in research papers are still supported and are developed by industry. \\n8. MDE and template-based code generation \\nOverall, 64% of the publications followed MDE techniques and principles. For example in [73] , the authors propose a sim- \\nulation environment with an architecture that aims at integrating tools for modeling, simulation, analysis, and collaboration. \\nAs expected, most of the publications using output-based and predeﬁned techniques are classiﬁed as model-based papers. \\nThe remaining 36% of the publications did not use MDE. This includes all papers that use a rule-based template style as \\nreported in Section 6 . For example, the authors in [40] developed a system that handles the implementation of dependable \\napplications and offers a better certiﬁcation process for the fault-tolerance mechanisms. \\nAs Fig. 11 shows, the evolution of the MDE category reveals that MDE-based approach started over passing non MDE- \\nbased techniques in 2005, except for 2006. It increased to reach a peak in 2013 and then started decreasing as the general \\ntrend of the corpus. Overall, MDE-based techniques for TBCG have been dominating other techniques in the past 12 years. \\nWe also analyzed the classiﬁcation of only MDE papers with respect to the characteristics presented in Section 3 . We \\nonly focus here on facets with different results compared to the general trend of papers. We found that only half of the \\ntotal number of papers using unspeciﬁed and other tools are MDE-based papers. We only found one paper that uses a \\nprogramming language as design-time input with MDE [74] . This analysis also shows that the year 2005 clearly marked the \\nshift from schema to domain-speciﬁc design-time inputs, as witnessed in Section 5.2 . Thus after general purpose, which \\nobtains 69% of the publications, domain speciﬁc accounts for a better score of 26%, while schema obtains only 4%. With \\nrespect to the run-time category, the use of domain-speciﬁc models increased to reach a peak in 2013. As expected, no \\nprogram code is used for MDE papers, because MDE typically does not consider them as models, unless a metamodel of the \\nprogramming language is used. \\n11 Refers to the union of other and unspeciﬁed categories of the tool facet.'),\n",

Discussion \\n9.1. RQ1: What are the trends in TBCG? \\nThe statistical results from this signiﬁcantly large sample of papers clearly suggest that TBCG has received suﬃcient \\nattention from the research community. The community has maintained a production rate in-line with the last 11 years \\naverage, especially with a constant rate of appearance in journal articles. The only exceptions were a signiﬁcant boost in \\n2013 and a dip in 2015. The lack of retention of papers appearing in non MDE may indicate that TBCG is now applied \\nin development projects rather than being a critical research problem to solve. Also, conference papers as well as venues \\noutside MDE and software engineering had a signiﬁcant impact on the evolution of TBCG. Given that TBCG seems to have \\nreached a steady publication rate since 2005, we can expect contributions from the research community to continue in that \\ntrend. \\n9.2. RQ2: What are the characteristics of TBCG approaches? \\nOur classiﬁcation scheme constitutes the main source to answer this question. The results clearly indicate the preferences \\nthe research community has regarding TBCG. Output-based templates have always been the most popular style from the \\nbeginning. Nevertheless, there have been some attempts to propose other template styles, like the rule-based style, but they \\ndid not catch on. Because of its simplicity to use, the predeﬁned style is probably still popular in practice, but it is less \\nmentioned in research papers. TBCG has been used to synthesize a variety of application code or documents. As expected, \\nthe study shows that modeling language inputs have prevailed over any other type. Speciﬁcally for MDE approaches to TBCG, \\nthe input to transform is moving from general purpose to domain-speciﬁc models. Academic researchers have contributed \\nmost, as expected with a literature review, but we found that industry is actively and continuously using TBCG as well. The \\nstudy also shows that the community is moving from large-scale applications to smaller-sized examples in research papers. \\nThis concurs with the level of maturity of this synthesis approach. The study conﬁrms that the community uses TBCG to \\ngenerate mainly source code. This trend is set to continue since the automation of computerized tasks is continuing to gain \\nground in all ﬁelds. Finally, TBCG has been implemented in many domains, software engineering and embedded systems \\nbeing the most popular, but also unexpectedly in unrelated domains, such as bio-medicine and ﬁnance. \\n9.3. RQ3: To what extent are TBCG tools being used in research? \\nIn this study, we discovered a total of 82 different tools for TBCG that are mentioned in research papers. Many studies \\nimplemented code generation with a custom-made tool that was never or seldom reused. This indicates that the develop- \\nment of new tools is still very active. MDE tools are the most popular. Since the research community has favored output- \\nbased template style, this has particularly inﬂuenced the tools implementation. This template style allows for more ﬁne- \\ngrained customization of the synthesis logic which seems to be what users have favored. This particular aspect is also \\ninﬂuencing the expansion of TBCG into industry. Most popular tool are actively supported by industry. Well-known tools \\nlike Acceleo, Xpand and Velocity are moving from being simple research material to effective development resources in in- \\ndustry. Finally, the study There are many TBCG tools that are popular in industry that fall under the “Other tools” category \\nbecause they are rarely reported in the scientiﬁc literature (under 1% of the papers in our corpus). Since this study is a lit- \\nerature review, the presence of a tool in this study is biased towards the what is published, and may not reﬂect the reality \\nin industry.

RQ4: What is the place of MDE in TBCG? \\nAll this analysis clearly concludes that the advent of MDE has been driving TBCG research. In fact, MDE has led to \\nincrease the average number of publications by a factor of four. There are many advantages to code generation, such as \\nreduced development effort, easier to write and understand domain/application concepts and less error-prone [8] . These are, \\nin fact, the pillar principles of MDE and domain-speciﬁc modeling [2] . Thus, it is not surprising to see that many, though \\nnot exclusively, code generation tools came out from the MDE community. As TBCG became a commonplace in general, \\nthe research in this area is now mostly conducted by the MDE community. Furthermore, MDE has brought very popular \\ntools that have encountered a great success, and they are also contributing to the expansion of TBCG across industry. It \\nis important to mention that the MDE community publishes in speciﬁc venues like Models , Sosym , or Ecmfa unlike other \\nresearch communities where the venues are very diversiﬁed. This resulted in three MDE venues at the top of the ranking. \\n9.5. Identiﬁed challenges \\nAfter thoroughly analyzing each paper in the corpus, we noted several problems that the research community has ne- \\nglected in TBCG. First, we found 66% of the papers did not provide any assessment of the code generation process or the \\ngenerated output. We only found one paper with a formal veriﬁcation of the generated code using non-functional require- \\nment analysis [75] . Furthermore, the TBCG can be veriﬁed through benchmarks as in [55] . Second, we found no paper that \\ninvestigates eﬃciency of code generation. Researchers may be inspired from other related communities, such as compiler \\noptimization [60] . Third, designing templates requires skillful engineering. Good practices, design patterns and other forms \\nof good reusable idioms would be of great value to developers [76] . \\n9.6. Threats to validity \\nThe results presented in this survey have depended on many factors that could potentially threaten its validity. \\n9.6.1. Construction validity \\nIn a strict sense, our ﬁndings are valid only for our sample that we collected from 20 0 0–2016. This leads to determine \\nwhether the primary studies used in our survey are a good representation of the whole population. From Fig. 3 , we can \\nobserve that our sample can be attributed as a representative sample of the whole population. In particular, the average \\nnumber of identiﬁed primary studies per year is 28 with standard deviation 15.76. A more systematic selection process \\nwould have been diﬃcult to be exhaustive about TBCG. We chose to obtain the best possible coverage at the cost of du- \\nplications. Nevertheless, the size of the corpus we classiﬁed is about ten times larger than other systematic reviews related \\nto code generation (see Section 2.4 ). We are, therefore, conﬁdent that this sample is a representative subset of all relevant \\npublications on TBCG. \\nAnother potential limitation is the query formulation for the keyword search. It is diﬃcult to encode a query that is \\nrestrictive enough to discard unrelated publications, but at the same time retrieves all the relevant ones. In order to obtain \\na satisfactory balance, we included synonyms and captured possible declinations. In this study, we are only interested in \\ncode generation. Therefore we discarded articles where TBCG was used for reporting or mass mailing, for example. We \\nbelieve that our sample is large enough that additional papers will not signiﬁcantly affect the general trends and results. \\nWe are fully aware that, since TBCG is widely used in practice, industries have their own tools and many have not been \\npublished in academic venues. Our goal was not to be exhaustive, but to get a representative sample. \\n9.6.2. Internal validity \\nA potential limitation is related to data extraction. It is diﬃcult to extract data from relevant publications, especially \\nwhen the quality of the paper is low, when code generation is not the primary contribution of the paper, or when critical \\ninformation for the classiﬁcation is not directly available in the paper. For example in [77] , the authors only mention the \\nname of the tool used to generate the code. In order to mitigate this threat, we had to resort to searching for additional \\ninformation about the tool: reading other publications that use the tool, traversing the website of the tool, installing the \\ntool, or discussing with the tools experts. \\nAnother possible threat is the screening of papers based on inclusion and exclusion criteria that we deﬁned before the \\nstudy was conducted. During this process, we examined only the title, the abstract. Therefore, there is a probability that we \\nexcluded relevant publications such as [55] , that do not include any TBCG terms. In order to mitigate this threat, whenever \\nwe were unsure whether a publication should be excluded or not we conservatively opted to include it. However, during \\nclassiﬁcation when reading the whole content of the paper, we may still have excluded it. \\n9.6.3. External validity \\nThe results we obtained are based on TBCG only. Even though our classiﬁcation scheme includes facets like orientation, \\napplication domain, that are not related to the area, we followed a topic based classiﬁcation. The core characteristics of our \\nstudy are strictly related to this particular code synthesis technique. We have deﬁned characteristics like template style and \\nthe two levels of inputs that we believe are exclusive to TBCG. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to other code \\ngeneration techniques mentioned in Section 2.2 .'),\n",

Syriani et al. / Computer Languages, Systems & Structures 52 (2018) 43–62 \\n9.6.4. Conclusion validity \\nOur study is based on a large number of primary studies. This helps us mitigate the potential threats related to the \\nconclusions of our study. A missing paper or a wrongly classiﬁed paper would have a very low impact on the statistics \\ncompared to a smaller number of primary studies. In addition, as a senior reviewer did a sanity check on the rejected \\npapers, we are conﬁdent that we did not miss a signiﬁcant number of papers. Hence, the chances for wrong conclusions are \\nsmall. Replication of this study can be achieved as we provided all the details of our research method in Section 3 . Also, our \\nstudy follows the methodology described in [20] . \\n10. Conclusion \\nThis paper reports the results of a large survey we conducted on the topic of TBCG, which has been missing in the \\nliterature. The objectives of this study are to better understand the characteristics of TBCG techniques and associated tools, \\nidentify research trends, and assess the importance of the role that MDE plays. The analysis of this corpus is organized into \\nfacets of a novel classiﬁcation scheme, which is of great value to modeling and software engineering researchers who are \\ninterested in painting an overview of the literature on TBCG. \\nOur study shows that the community has been diversely using TBCG over the past 16 years, and that research and \\ndevelopment is still very active. TBCG has greatly beneﬁted from MDE in 2005 and 2013 which mark the two peaks of \\nthe evolution of this area, tripling the average number of publications. In addition, TBCG has favored a template style that \\nis output-based and modeling languages as input. It has been applied in a variety of domains. The community has been \\nfavoring the use of custom tools for code generation over popular ones. Most research using TBCG follows an MDE approach. \\nFurthermore, both MDE and non-MDE tools are becoming effective development resources in industry. \\nThe study also revealed that, although the research in TBCG is mature enough, there are many open issues that can \\nbe addressed in the future, upstream and downstream the generation itself. Upstream, the deﬁnition of templates is not \\na trivial task. Supporting the developers in such a deﬁnition is a must. Downstream, methods and techniques need to be \\ndeﬁned to assess the correctness and quality of the generated code. \\nWe believe this survey will be of beneﬁt to someone familiar with code generation by knowing how their favorite tool \\nranks in popularity within the research community, the relevance and importance of the use of templates, and in which \\ncontext TBCG has been applied (application domain). The relations across categories in Section VI show non-intuitive results \\nas well. The paper also promotes MDE in ﬁelds that have not been traditionally exposed to it. \\nSupplementary material \\nSupplementary material associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at 10.1016/j.cl.2017.11.003 . \\nReferences \\n[1] Rich C , Waters RC .

A particularly intriguing\\napplication of LLMs is code generation, a task that involves producing source code from natural\\nlanguage descriptions. Despite varying definitions across studies [51, 221, 238, 269], for the main\\nscope of this survey, we focus on the code generation task and adopt a consistent definition of code\\ngeneration as the natural-language-to-code (NL2Code) task [16, 17, 307].

Second, it makes ranking simpler to write for DSL\\ndesigners because the precedence already builds in a default ranking over programs.\\nCuts and precedence provide DSL designers two new mechanisms to control the program search\\nspace, beyond what they get through designing DSLs. Our contributions include:\\n• A new algorithmic approach for PBE (middle-out synthesis) that leverages a novel cut rule to\\nspeed up synthesis over large DSLs and to handle non-EI and non-EE operators.\\n• A new formalism of guarded DSLs that supports operator precedence, and an extension of'),\n",

Code generation \\nIn this paper, we view code generation as in automatic programming [1] rather than compilers. The underlying principle \\nof automatic programming is that a user deﬁnes what he expects from the program and the program should be automat- \\nically generated by a software without any assistance by the user. This generative approach is different from a compiler \\napproach. Compilers produce code executable by a computer from a speciﬁcation conforming to a programming language, \\nwhereas automatic programming transforms user speciﬁcations into code which often conforms to a programming language. \\nCompilers have a phase called code generation that retrieves an abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and translates it \\ninto machine code or bytecode executable by a virtual machine. Compared to code generation as in automatic programming, \\ncompilers can be regarded as tasks or services that are incorporated in or post-positioned to code generators [7] .'),\n",

One \\nparticular kind of model transformation is devoted to code generation with model-to-text transformations (M2T) [12] . In \\ngeneral, M2T transforms a model (often in the form of a graph structure) into a linearized textual representation.

A particularly intriguing\\napplication of LLMs is code generation, a task that involves producing source code from natural\\nlanguage descriptions. Despite varying definitions across studies [51, 221, 238, 269], for the main\\nscope of this survey, we focus on the code generation task and adopt a consistent definition of code\\ngeneration as the natural-language-to-code (NL2Code) task [16, 17, 307].

Some\\npotential risks include:\\n• Malware Infection: The code could contain viruses, worms, or trojans that compromise our\\nsystem’s security.\\n• Data Loss: It might delete or corrupt important files and data.\\n• Unauthorized Access: It can create backdoors, allowing attackers to access our system\\nremotely.\\n• Performance Issues: The code might consume excessive resources, slowing down our\\nsystem.\\n• Privacy Breaches: Sensitive information, such as passwords or personal data, might be\\nstolen.\\n• System Damage: It may alter system settings or damage hardware components.'),\n",

Code generation \\nIn this paper, we view code generation as in automatic programming [1] rather than compilers. The underlying principle \\nof automatic programming is that a user deﬁnes what he expects from the program and the program should be automat- \\nically generated by a software without any assistance by the user. This generative approach is different from a compiler \\napproach. Compilers produce code executable by a computer from a speciﬁcation conforming to a programming language, \\nwhereas automatic programming transforms user speciﬁcations into code which often conforms to a programming language. \\nCompilers have a phase called code generation that retrieves an abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and translates it \\ninto machine code or bytecode executable by a virtual machine. Compared to code generation as in automatic programming, \\ncompilers can be regarded as tasks or services that are incorporated in or post-positioned to code generators [7] .'),\n",

Predeﬁned style is reserved for approaches where the template used for code generation is deﬁned \\ninternally to the tool. However, a subset of the static part of the template is customizable to vary slightly the gener- \\nated output. This is, for example, the case for common CASE tools where there is a predeﬁned template to synthesize \\na class diagram into a number of programming languages. Nevertheless, the user can specify what construct to use for \\nmany-cardinality associations, e.g., Array or ArrayList for Java templates.

RQ4: What is the place of MDE in TBCG? \\nAll this analysis clearly concludes that the advent of MDE has been driving TBCG research. In fact, MDE has led to \\nincrease the average number of publications by a factor of four. There are many advantages to code generation, such as \\nreduced development effort, easier to write and understand domain/application concepts and less error-prone [8] . These are, \\nin fact, the pillar principles of MDE and domain-speciﬁc modeling [2] . Thus, it is not surprising to see that many, though \\nnot exclusively, code generation tools came out from the MDE community. As TBCG became a commonplace in general, \\nthe research in this area is now mostly conducted by the MDE community. Furthermore, MDE has brought very popular \\ntools that have encountered a great success, and they are also contributing to the expansion of TBCG across industry. It'),\n",

Identiﬁed challenges \\nAfter thoroughly analyzing each paper in the corpus, we noted several problems that the research community has ne- \\nglected in TBCG. First, we found 66% of the papers did not provide any assessment of the code generation process or the \\ngenerated output. We only found one paper with a formal veriﬁcation of the generated code using non-functional require- \\nment analysis [75] . Furthermore, the TBCG can be veriﬁed through benchmarks as in [55] .

A particularly intriguing\\napplication of LLMs is code generation, a task that involves producing source code from natural\\nlanguage descriptions. Despite varying definitions across studies [51, 221, 238, 269], for the main\\nscope of this survey, we focus on the code generation task and adopt a consistent definition of code\\ngeneration as the natural-language-to-code (NL2Code) task [16, 17, 307]. To enhance clarity, the\\ndifferentiation between code generation and other code-related tasks, along with a more nuanced\\ndefinition, is summarized in Table 1.

       " 'differentiation between code generation and other code-related tasks, along with a more nuanced\\ndefinition, is summarized in Table 1. This area has garnered substantial interest from both academia\\nand industry, as evidenced by the development of tools like GitHub Copilot2 [48], CodeGeeX3 [321],\\nand Amazon CodeWhisperer4, which leverage groundbreaking code LLMs to facilitate software\\ndevelopment.\\nInitial investigations into code generation primarily utilized heuristic rules or expert systems,\\nsuch as probabilistic grammar-based frameworks [10, 62, 119, 125, 288] and specialized language\\nmodels [64, 83, 117]. These early techniques were typically rigid and difficult to scale. However,\\nthe introduction of Transformer-based LLMs has shifted the paradigm, establishing them as the\\npreferred method due to their superior proficiency and versatility.

This emergent ability has democratized coding,\\nmaking it accessible to a broader audience [307]. The performance of LLMs on code generation\\ntasks has seen remarkable improvements, as illustrated by the HumanEval leaderboard5, which\\nshowcases the evolution from PaLM 8B [54] of 3.6% to LDB [325] of 95.1% on Pass@1 metrics.\\nAs can be seen, the HumanEval benchmark [48] has been established as a de facto standard for\\nevaluating the coding proficiency of LLMs [48].\\nTo offer a comprehensive chronological evolution, we present an overview of the development\\nof LLMs for code generation, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Despite this promising progress, there are still numerous\\nchallenges that need to be addressed. These challenges are mainly caused by the gap between\\nacademia and practical development. For example, in academia, the HumanEval benchmark has\\nbeen established as a de facto standard for evaluating the coding proficiency of LLMs. However,\\nmany works have illustrated the evaluation of HumanEval can’t reflect the scenario of practical\\ndevelopment [68, 72, 123, 162].

To compile these challenges, we\\ninterviewed several product managers in these teams, interacted with both expert and novice users\\nof the FlashFill feature, and analyzed online help posts.\\nGenerating Readable Code. Consider the task of transforming the input pair (\"David Walker\",\\n\"623179\") to the output string \"D-6231#walker\". Any string processing library would contain\\nmany redundant methods for extracting \"Walker\" from \"David Walker\". For example, in Python,\\nwe could use the split method to accomplish the task. Alternatively, we could use the find method\\nalong with string slicing, or use regular expressions.',\n",

Alternatively, we could use the find method\\nalong with string slicing, or use regular expressions.\\nIn contrast to the design of string processing libraries, the prevailing wisdom in DSL design for\\nsynthesis has been to work with a minimal number of operators [Gulwani 2016]. For example,\\nFlashFill [Gulwani 2011] and the more recent Duet [Lee 2021] DSLs contain only 3 and 5 functions\\nthat directly operate on strings, respectively. Smaller DSLs lead to smaller program search spaces,\\nyielding better synthesis performance and effective ranking [Polozov and Gulwani 2015]. Following\\nthis minimalism to an extreme can lead to a DSL whose programs translate to very unnatural and\\nunreadable programs in target languages like Python (see Figure 1) or PowerFx (see Figure 2).\\nOne straightforward approach to readability is writing a good translator from the synthesis DSL',\n",

The lack of readable\\ncode is one of the primary challenges preventing a broader adoption of PBE technologies.\\nMultiple Target Languages.

The assumption that the\\nprecedence is a series-parallel partial order is not required if we start with the gDSL (rather than\\nstart with precedences), which is what we do in practice. The assumption that the reachability\\nrelation on the grammar nonterminals be acyclic is required only to provide a clean mathematical\\ninterpretation of the ranking induced by gDSL on programs (terms) as a path ordering.

       " 'interpretation of the ranking induced by gDSL on programs (terms) as a path ordering. In the\\npresence of cycles, the synthesis rule and the full system can still be used without problems, but\\nranking cannot be described in a simple way.\\n8\\nCONCLUSION\\nWe introduced two techniques, cuts and precedence through guarded DSLs, that DSL designers can\\nuse to prune search in programming by example. Cuts enable a novel synthesis strategy: middle-\\nout synthesis. This strategy allows FlashFill++ to support synthesis tasks that require non-EI/EE\\noperators, such as datetime and numeric transformations. The use of precedence through gDSLs\\nallows us to increase the size of our DSL, by incorporating redundant operators, which facilitate\\nreadable code generation in different target languages.

The underlying principle \\nof automatic programming is that a user deﬁnes what he expects from the program and the program should be automat- \\nically generated by a software without any assistance by the user. This generative approach is different from a compiler \\napproach. Compilers produce code executable by a computer from a speciﬁcation conforming to a programming language, \\nwhereas automatic programming transforms user speciﬁcations into code which often conforms to a programming language. \\nCompilers have a phase called code generation that retrieves an abstract syntax tree produced by a parser and translates it \\ninto machine code or bytecode executable by a virtual machine.

One \\nparticular kind of model transformation is devoted to code generation with model-to-text transformations (M2T) [12] . In \\ngeneral, M2T transforms a model (often in the form of a graph structure) into a linearized textual representation. M2T is \\nused to produce various text artifacts, e.g., to generate code, to serialize models, to generate documentation and reports, or \\nto visualize and explore models.

There are commonly ﬁve different code generation approaches present in the literature [7,12] : \\nVisitor based approaches consist of programmatically traversing the internal representation of the input, while relying \\non an API dedicated to manipulate the input, to write the output to a text stream. This requires to program directly \\nthe creation of the output ﬁles and storing the strings while navigating through the data structure of the input. The \\nimplementation typically makes use of the visitor design pattern [13] .

We used the search string from Section 3.2 to retrieve all papers from these three databases. We obtained 7 646 \\ncandidate papers that satisfy the query and the options of the search stated in Section 3.3.2 . We then removed automatically \\nall duplicates using EndNote software. This resulted in 5 131 candidate papers for the screening phase. \\n3.5.2. Screening \\nBased on the exclusion criteria stated in Section 3.3.2 , each candidate paper was screened by at least two reviewers to \\ndecide on its inclusion. To make the screening phase more eﬃcient, we used a home-made tool [30] . After all the reviewers \\ncompleted screening the papers they were assigned, the tool calculates an inter-rater agreement coeﬃcient. In our case, the \\nCohens Kappa coeﬃcient was 0.813.

Apart from CASE \\ntools, we also classiﬁed papers like [37] as predeﬁned style since the output code is already ﬁxed as HTML and the pro- \\ngrammer uses the tags to change some values based on the model. Each year, around 28% of the papers were using the \\npredeﬁned style, except for a peak of 39% in 2005, given the popularity of CASE tools then. \\nWe found 19 publications that used rule-based style templates.

      "Answer: The characteristics of template-based code generation (TBCG) can be identified as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Components**: TBCG consists of four main components:\n",
      "   - **Data**: The input data used to generate the code.\n",
      "   - **Template**: A predefined structure that contains placeholders for the data.\n",
      "   - **Output**: The generated code, which is the result of combining the data and template.\n",
      "   - **Meta-information**: The generation logic of the template, which is not explicitly mentioned by Jörges but is considered a crucial component.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Template**: The template is a key component of TBCG, which favors reuse following the principle of \"write once, produce many\". This means that the same template can be used to generate multiple artifacts by varying the input data.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Synthesis technique**: TBCG is considered a synthesis technique that uses templates to generate code. This approach requires less effort from programmers to develop code generators, making it an efficient method for code generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Code generation**: TBCG is used to generate source code from various inputs, such as UML diagrams, and can be used in various domains, including web development and Computer-Aided Software Engineering (CASE) tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Error detection**: TBCG helps detect errors in the input artifact early on, before the generated code is compiled, which improves the overall quality of the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Reusability**: TBCG promotes reusability, as the same template can be used to generate multiple artifacts, reducing the effort required to develop code generators.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Flexibility**: TBCG can be used with various programming languages and can be integrated with other code generation techniques, such as programmatically generating code or using meta-object protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Simple to use**: TBCG is considered a simple approach to code generation, as it requires less effort from programmers to develop code generators, making it an accessible method for code generation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the characteristics of TBCG make it a popular approach for code generation, as it promotes reusability, flexibility, and simplicity, while also improving the quality of the generated code.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "Final Answer: The characteristics of template-based code generation (TBCG) can be identified as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Components**: TBCG consists of four main components:\n",
      "   - **Data**: This refers to the input or the information that will be used to generate the code.\n",
      "   - **Template**: A template is a pre-defined structure or pattern that contains placeholders for the data. It serves as a blueprint for generating the output code.\n",
      "   - **Output**: The generated code, which is the result of combining the template with the data.\n",
      "   - **Meta-information/Generation Logic**: This is the underlying logic or rules that govern how the template is populated with the data to produce the output code.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Template Reuse**: One of the key characteristics of TBCG is the principle of \"write once, produce many.\" This means that a single template can be reused multiple times with different data sets to generate a variety of output codes, promoting code reuse and reducing development effort.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Separation of Concerns**: TBCG allows for a clear separation between the template (which defines the structure of the output code) and the data (which provides the specific details for each instance of code generation). This separation makes it easier to maintain and update either the template or the data without affecting the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Flexibility and Customizability**: Templates can be designed to be highly flexible, allowing for the generation of code in various programming languages, formats, and styles. This flexibility is crucial for adapting to different project requirements or technological environments.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Error Detection**: TBCG facilitates early detection of errors in the input data or the template itself. Since the generation process occurs before the code is compiled, errors can be identified and corrected at an early stage, improving the overall quality of the generated code.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Efficiency**: By automating the code generation process, TBCG can significantly reduce the time and effort required for coding, especially for repetitive or boilerplate code. This efficiency gain can lead to faster development cycles and lower costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Scalability**: Template-based code generation can handle large and complex projects by generating code for multiple components or modules from a set of templates and data sources. This scalability is essential for large-scale software development projects.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Integration with Development Tools and Methodologies**: TBCG can be integrated with various development tools, such as CASE (Computer-Aided Software Engineering) tools, and methodologies like Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). This integration enhances the capabilities of these tools and methodologies by automating code generation based on models or specifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, template-based code generation is characterized by its components, the principle of template reuse, separation of concerns, flexibility, error detection capabilities, efficiency, scalability, and its potential for integration with other development tools and methodologies. These characteristics make TBCG a powerful approach for automating code generation in software development.\n",
